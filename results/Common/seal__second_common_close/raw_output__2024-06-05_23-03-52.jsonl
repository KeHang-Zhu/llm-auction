This strategy should maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding.'

This strategy follows my previous approach of bidding slightly below my perceived value to maximize my profit potential while considering the variability in Betty's bids. In the past rounds, my strategy has been to bid enough to have a high probability of winning but not so high that I significantly reduce my potential profits.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 60.

In Round 5, a bid of 65 won and paid a second-highest bid of 57, leading to a positive profit. Historically, bids close to my perceived value but slightly below, such as in Round 2 (68), tend to balance winning probability and profit potential. Therefore, I will bid 68 to maximize my chances of winning without overpaying significantly.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 54.

This amount is high enough to have a strong chance of winning against Betty's bids, which have varied but often fall below this range, without excessively reducing my potential profit. Bidding 70 allows me to strike a balance between the cost of winning and the potential gain from the prize's true value.'

In Round 5, a bid of 65 won and paid a second-highest bid of 57, leading to a positive profit. Historically, bids close to my perceived value but slightly below, such as in Round 2 (68), tend to balance winning probability and profit potential. Therefore, I will bid 68 to maximize my chances of winning without overpaying significantly.'

The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69, and based on the previous rounds, Betty's bids tend to vary but often fall in the range that is reasonably below her perceived value. By bidding 54, I aim to balance the probability of winning with avoiding overbidding. This bid has a good chance of beating lower bids from Betty while still allowing potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70.

This amount is high enough to have a strong chance of winning against Betty's bids, which have varied but often fall below this range, without excessively reducing my potential profit. Bidding 70 allows me to strike a balance between the cost of winning and the potential gain from the prize's true value.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40 this round, I aim to maximize profit while maintaining a good chance of winning. Historically, bids close to my perceived value but slightly lower have yielded better results. Since previous second-highest bids from Betty have varied but often fall a bit below my bids, I will go with 33, which balances the probability of winning without overbidding.'

In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 82 this round, I want to bid in a way that maximizes my profit while considering previous rounds where the second-highest bids have varied. In Round 5, a bid of 65 won and paid a second-highest bid of 57, leading to a positive profit. Historically, bids close to my perceived value but slightly below, such as in Round 2 (68), tend to balance winning probability and profit potential. Therefore, I will bid 68 to maximize my chances of winning without overpaying significantly.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 54. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 54. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69, and based on the previous rounds, Betty's bids tend to vary but often fall in the range that is reasonably below her perceived value. By bidding 54, I aim to balance the probability of winning with avoiding overbidding. This bid has a good chance of beating lower bids from Betty while still allowing potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 85, and considering the history of previous rounds where bidding close to but below my value has balanced winning probability and profit potential, I will bid 70. This amount is high enough to have a strong chance of winning against Betty's bids, which have varied but often fall below this range, without excessively reducing my potential profit. Bidding 70 allows me to strike a balance between the cost of winning and the potential gain from the prize's true value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 85 and considering the history of previous rounds where bidding close to but below my value has balanced winning probability and profit potential, I will bid 70. This amount is high enough to have a strong chance of winning against Betty's bids, which have varied but often fall below this range, without excessively reducing my potential profit. Bidding 70 allows me to strike a balance between the cost of winning and the potential gain from the prize's true value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40 this round, I aim to maximize profit while maintaining a good chance of winning. Historically, bids close to my perceived value but slightly lower have yielded better results. Since previous second-highest bids from Betty have varied but often fall a bit below my bids, I will go with 33, which balances the probability of winning without overbidding.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 71, I aim to maximize my profit while maintaining a good chance of winning. Analyzing the previous rounds, Betty's bids have often fallen slightly below my bids when they are in the higher range. Therefore, bidding 58 offers a balance between winning the auction and avoiding overbidding, considering that the second-highest bid from Betty is likely to be slightly lower.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 27. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 32, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value to increase the chances of winning while avoiding overbidding. Historically, bidding around 5 units below my perceived value has balanced the winning probability and profit potential effectively. Betty's bids have varied but often fall in a range that would make this strategy advantageous.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 19 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that in the previous rounds, the second-highest bid was 10 and 56 respectively, and considering my value for the prize is 42, I want to place a strategic bid. I aim to avoid overbidding, thus securing a profit if I win. Bidding 30 allows for a cautious yet competitive approach, ensuring my profit margin based on the perceived value.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 14, and recalling previous rounds where lower perceived values tended to have winning bids in the 6 to 10 range, I'll aim to bid conservatively to maximize potential profit if I win. A bid of 10 balances the risk of not overpaying while providing a competitive edge based on the previous round data.'

From past rounds, it's evident that second-highest bids have ranged from 10 to 56. A bid of 38 strikes a balance, being aggressive enough to potentially secure the prize but conservative enough to ensure a good profit margin if I win.'

In past rounds, second-highest bids have ranged from 10 to 56. Bidding 57 strikes a balance between being aggressive to win the prize and leaving room for profit, considering the values are redrawn independently each round.'

The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 24 and analyzing previous rounds where higher or aggressive bids resulted in significant overpayments or losses, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive and ensuring a positive profit margin. Bidding 15 takes into account the pattern of second-highest bids, hedging against overbidding while remaining in contention to win the prize.'

In previous rounds with similar or lower perceived values, the highest winning bids tended to range between 6 and 10. With my current value of 11, bidding 7 positions me competitively without significantly risking overpayment, based on the likelihood of the second-highest bid.'

When my value was relatively high (96), I bid substantially (64) and won, gaining a reasonable profit. Currently, with a value of 46, it seems wise to bid moderately. By bidding 32, I aim to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a profit margin if Betty's bid is lower.

From past rounds, it's evident that second-highest bids have ranged from 10 to 56.

In previous rounds with similar or lower perceived values, the highest winning bids tended to range between 6 and 10. With my current value of 11, bidding 7 positions me competitively without significantly risking overpayment, based on the likelihood of the second-highest bid.'

When my value was relatively high (96), I bid substantially (64) and won, gaining a reasonable profit. Currently, with a value of 46, it seems wise to bid moderately. By bidding 32, I aim to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a profit margin if Betty's bid is lower. This bid is neither too high nor too low, considering the independent redraws each round and the presence of uncertainty about Betty's value.'

With the goal of maximizing profit and considering the variability in Betty's bids, a bid of 37 aims to strike a balance between a competitive bid and ensuring a better profit margin if I win.

From previous rounds, I've noticed Betty's bids vary significantly, from as low as 10 to as high as 56.

From previous rounds, I have noticed that bids around 50-60% of my perceived value often balance risk and potential profit effectively. Therefore, I choose to bid 6, anticipating that this strategy will likely secure the prize at a reasonable cost if Betty's perceived value is even lower.'

Previous rounds have shown that bidding too close to the perceived value (especially when it is low) can lead to minimal or negative profits. I want to bid conservatively to potentially win against a low bid from Betty while staying profitable.'

From previous rounds, I've observed that moderate bids around 60-70% of my perceived value often lead to better outcomes.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 14 and based on the history of previous rounds, a conservative bid near half of my perceived value has often been competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous bids near this value have yielded profits, so bidding 10 positions me with a reasonable chance of winning without greatly risking a negative profit.'

From previous rounds, lower perceived values have generally had winning bids in the 6 to 15 range. Bidding 12 positions me well to win without significantly risking overpayment, considering the likely second-highest bid based on historical patterns.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, my strategy has been to bid proportionally to my perceived value. When my value was relatively high (96), I bid substantially (64) and won, gaining a reasonable profit. Currently, with a value of 46, it seems wise to bid moderately. By bidding 32, I aim to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a profit margin if Betty's bid is lower. This bid is neither too high nor too low, considering the independent redraws each round and the presence of uncertainty about Betty's value.'

From previous rounds, Betty's bids varied (10 in round 0, 56 in round 1, and 30 in round 2), indicating she might bid higher or lower depending on her perceived value.

With the goal of maximizing profit and considering the variability in Betty's bids, a bid of 37 aims to strike a balance between a competitive bid and ensuring a better profit margin if I win. This bid respects the independent redraws each round while aiming to strategically outbid Betty.'

The winner's profit was 21.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 94, I need to make a strong bid to have a high chance of winning while ensuring an optimal profit margin. From previous rounds, I've noticed Betty's bids vary significantly, from as low as 10 to as high as 56. By bidding 65, I aim to outbid Betty in most scenarios while ensuring that the second-highest bid still gives me a reasonable profit, considering the independent redraws each round.'

From previous rounds, I have noticed that bids around 50-60% of my perceived value often balance risk and potential profit effectively. Therefore, I choose to bid 6, anticipating that this strategy will likely secure the prize at a reasonable cost if Betty's perceived value is even lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9 and historical behavior, it is strategic to consider lower bids in such scenarios to minimize potential losses. Previous rounds have shown that bidding too close to the perceived value (especially when it is low) can lead to minimal or negative profits. I want to bid conservatively to potentially win against a low bid from Betty while staying profitable.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22, I have to balance the risk of overbidding with the need to win the bid. From previous rounds, I've observed that moderate bids around 60-70% of my perceived value often lead to better outcomes. With this in mind and considering the variability in Betty's past bids, a bid of 15 should be competitive without excessively risking my profit margins.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 39.

This approach helps to balance the risk of overbidding with a reasonable chance of winning. By bidding 39, I aim to outbid Betty while maintaining a good profit margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Based on Betty's past bids, this bid should be competitive enough to maximize my chances of winning without excessively risking my profit.'

The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and analyzing previous rounds, the second-highest bids have varied widely, typically between 10 and 56. To balance competitiveness and maximizing profit, bidding 42 situates me well to potentially win without overbidding. This approach hedges against the risk of losses while maintaining a good likelihood of securing the prize, based on past patterns observed.'

From the previous round, where I bid relatively low and lost, it's evident that a higher bid can be worthwhile.

When my value was relatively high (96), I bid substantially (64) and won, gaining a reasonable profit. Currently, with a value of 46, it seems wise to bid moderately. By bidding 32, I aim to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a profit margin if Betty's bid is lower. This bid is neither too high nor too low, considering the independent redraws each round and the presence of uncertainty about Betty's value.'

From previous rounds, Betty's bids varied (10 in round 0, 56 in round 1, and 30 in round 2), indicating she might bid higher or lower depending on her perceived value.

With the goal of maximizing profit and considering the variability in Betty's bids, a bid of 37 aims to strike a balance between a competitive bid and ensuring a better profit margin if I win. This bid respects the independent redraws each round while aiming to strategically outbid Betty.'

From previous rounds, I've noticed Betty's bids vary significantly, from as low as 10 to as high as 56.

From previous rounds, I have noticed that bids around 50-60% of my perceived value often balance risk and potential profit effectively. Therefore, I choose to bid 6, anticipating that this strategy will likely secure the prize at a reasonable cost if Betty's perceived value is even lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9 and historical behavior, it is strategic to consider lower bids in such scenarios to minimize potential losses. Previous rounds have shown that bidding too close to the perceived value (especially when it is low) can lead to minimal or negative profits. I want to bid conservatively to potentially win against a low bid from Betty while staying profitable.'

From previous rounds, I've observed that moderate bids around 60-70% of my perceived value often lead to better outcomes. With this in mind and considering the variability in Betty's past bids, a bid of 15 should be competitive without excessively risking my profit margins.'

This approach helps to balance the risk of overbidding with a reasonable chance of winning. By bidding 39, I aim to outbid Betty while maintaining a good profit margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Based on Betty's past bids, this bid should be competitive enough to maximize my chances of winning without excessively risking my profit.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 14 and based on the history of previous rounds, a conservative bid near half of my perceived value has often been competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous bids near this value have yielded profits, so bidding 10 positions me with a reasonable chance of winning without greatly risking a negative profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 18, I will bid conservatively to ensure a profit if I win. From previous rounds, lower perceived values have generally had winning bids in the 6 to 15 range. Bidding 12 positions me well to win without significantly risking overpayment, considering the likely second-highest bid based on historical patterns.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and analyzing previous rounds, the second-highest bids have varied widely, typically between 10 and 56. To balance competitiveness and maximizing profit, bidding 42 situates me well to potentially win without overbidding. This approach hedges against the risk of losses while maintaining a good likelihood of securing the prize, based on past patterns observed.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 14 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 18 and analyzing the previous rounds, a conservative bid has generally been effective in balancing competitiveness while avoiding overpayment. In prior rounds where my values were similar, bids around 10 to 12 positioned me well without high risk. Thus, bidding 12 allows me to maintain a reasonable chance of winning without significantly risking overpayment.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 13 and analyzing historical data, lower values with conservative bids near half the perceived value have generally led to competitive yet profitable outcomes. In past rounds with low perceived values, bids around 6 to 12 have often been effective. Therefore, bidding 9 strikes a balance between competitiveness and minimizing the risk of overpayment, considering the likely second-highest bid based on historical patterns.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 63 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Since the bids have varied quite a bit and the successful approach in lower value rounds was conservative, I will bid 10 to balance the chance of winning the auction against the required payment, ensuring my profit is maximized without risking a high bid for a low-value prize.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 6 and the history of previous rounds where other bids were often higher for lower perceived values, I will bid conservatively at 3. This strategy minimizes potential loss without overcommitting, especially since previous similar situations showed that lower values generally lead to lower competition for the prize.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 54, and bids need to be balanced by potential gain and payment, a bid of 40 seems reasonable. This bid is high enough to potentially beat Andy without bidding too close to my perceived value, allowing for a profitable win if successful.'

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is high at 66 and previous rounds show Andy's highest bid was 45 when my bid was 40, a bid of 50 is strategic. It balances being competitive without bidding too close to my perceived value, providing a good chance to win while maximizing potential profit.'

In the previous rounds, Andy's highest bids were 45 and 44. I anticipate that Andy's bid will range around that area again. To minimize the risk of overbidding and ensuring a chance of profit, a bid of 20 provides a balance. This conservative strategy helps protect against overpaying in case the common value is significantly lower than Andy's perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I need to strike a balance between bidding competitively and maximizing profit. Based on Andy's previous bidding behavior (bids of 45, 44, and 5), it seems that Andy's bids can vary widely depending on his perceived value. By bidding 34, I aim to reduce the risk of overbidding while still being competitive. This bid is 12 units below my perceived value, mitigating the loss if I overbid against Andy's lower value perception, and yet remains high enough to potentially win if Andy's bid is close to but below this amount.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and recognizing from previous rounds that Andy's bids can range quite widely, it is important to bid conservatively when my perceived value is low. In round 2, I bid 20 when my value was 25, but Andy won with a bid of 5. This suggests that Andy's bids are sometimes significantly influenced by varying perceived values. Therefore, to maximize potential profit and reduce overbidding risks, a bid of 10 balances being competitive while protecting against the risk of paying too much if the common value is low.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 3, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 3 in this round, bidding higher than 3 would automatically result in a loss if I were to win. Andy's bids have varied significantly, but there are instances where he bids very low (e.g., his bid of 5 in round 2). Therefore, to balance the risk of overbidding and still having a slim chance to win without losing, I will bid slightly above my perceived value. The bid of 4 minimizes potential loss if Andy's bid is unexpectedly low, while still being cautious about an overvaluation.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and considering my previous experiences where Andy's bids have ranged from 5 to 58 depending on his perceived value, it is essential to bid conservatively under these low perceived values. History suggests that a cautious bid around half my perceived value allows me a chance to win without significant risk of overpaying. Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10.

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 54, and bids need to be balanced by potential gain and payment, a bid of 40 seems reasonable. This bid is high enough to potentially beat Andy without bidding too close to my perceived value, allowing for a profitable win if successful.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 44. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is high at 66 and previous rounds show Andy's highest bid was 45 when my bid was 40, a bid of 50 is strategic. It balances being competitive without bidding too close to my perceived value, providing a good chance to win while maximizing potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value towards the prize is 25. In the previous rounds, Andy's highest bids were 45 and 44. I anticipate that Andy's bid will range around that area again. To minimize the risk of overbidding and ensuring a chance of profit, a bid of 20 provides a balance. This conservative strategy helps protect against overpaying in case the common value is significantly lower than Andy's perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I need to strike a balance between bidding competitively and maximizing profit. Based on Andy's previous bidding behavior (bids of 45, 44, and 5), it seems that Andy's bids can vary widely depending on his perceived value. By bidding 34, I aim to reduce the risk of overbidding while still being competitive. This bid is 12 units below my perceived value, mitigating the loss if I overbid against Andy's lower value perception, and yet remains high enough to potentially win if Andy's bid is close to but below this amount.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and recognizing from previous rounds that Andy's bids can range quite widely, it is important to bid conservatively when my perceived value is low. In round 2, I bid 20 when my value was 25, but Andy won with a bid of 5. This suggests that Andy's bids are sometimes significantly influenced by varying perceived values. Therefore, to maximize potential profit and reduce overbidding risks, a bid of 10 balances being competitive while protecting against the risk of paying too much if the common value is low.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 3, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 3 in this round, bidding higher than 3 would automatically result in a loss if I were to win. Andy's bids have varied significantly, but there are instances where he bids very low (e.g., his bid of 5 in round 2). Therefore, to balance the risk of overbidding and still having a slim chance to win without losing, I will bid slightly above my perceived value. The bid of 4 minimizes potential loss if Andy's bid is unexpectedly low, while still being cautious about an overvaluation.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and considering my previous experiences where Andy's bids have ranged from 5 to 58 depending on his perceived value, it is essential to bid conservatively under these low perceived values. History suggests that a cautious bid around half my perceived value allows me a chance to win without significant risk of overpaying. Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly. Therefore, a bid of 10 continues to balance competitiveness against potential excessive loss if the common value is low.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40.

Analyzing the previous rounds, Andy's bids have varied widely between 3 and 58. I want to balance being competitive with ensuring that I don't overbid relative to the common value, which remains unknown. Bidding 40 gives me a reasonable chance to win, offering a buffer below my perceived value for potential profit while not being too aggressive given the variability in Andy's bids.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 55 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value towards the prize is 25. In the previous rounds, Andy's highest bids were 45 and 44. I anticipate that Andy's bid will range around that area again. To minimize the risk of overbidding and ensuring a chance of profit, a bid of 20 provides a balance. This conservative strategy helps protect against overpaying in case the common value is significantly lower than Andy's perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I need to strike a balance between bidding competitively and maximizing profit. Based on Andy's previous bidding behavior (bids of 45, 44, and 5), it seems that Andy's bids can vary widely depending on his perceived value. By bidding 34, I aim to reduce the risk of overbidding while still being competitive. This bid is 12 units below my perceived value, mitigating the loss if I overbid against Andy's lower value perception, and yet remains high enough to potentially win if Andy's bid is close to but below this amount.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and recognizing from previous rounds that Andy's bids can range quite widely, it is important to bid conservatively when my perceived value is low. In round 2, I bid 20 when my value was 25, but Andy won with a bid of 5. This suggests that Andy's bids are sometimes significantly influenced by varying perceived values. Therefore, to maximize potential profit and reduce overbidding risks, a bid of 10 balances being competitive while protecting against the risk of paying too much if the common value is low.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 3, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 3 in this round, bidding higher than 3 would automatically result in a loss if I were to win. Andy's bids have varied significantly, but there are instances where he bids very low (e.g., his bid of 5 in round 2). Therefore, to balance the risk of overbidding and still having a slim chance to win without losing, I will bid slightly above my perceived value. The bid of 4 minimizes potential loss if Andy's bid is unexpectedly low, while still being cautious about an overvaluation.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and considering my previous experiences where Andy's bids have ranged from 5 to 58 depending on his perceived value, it is essential to bid conservatively under these low perceived values. History suggests that a cautious bid around half my perceived value allows me a chance to win without significant risk of overpaying. Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly. Therefore, a bid of 10 continues to balance competitiveness against potential excessive loss if the common value is low.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for this round is 62. Analyzing the previous rounds, Andy's bids have varied widely between 3 and 58. I want to balance being competitive with ensuring that I don't overbid relative to the common value, which remains unknown. Bidding 40 gives me a reasonable chance to win, offering a buffer below my perceived value for potential profit while not being too aggressive given the variability in Andy's bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 55, and reflecting on previous bids where Andy's values have fluctuated, a bid of 40 seems to strike a balance. It is significantly below my perceived value, providing a good margin for profit if I win.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 3 in this round, bidding higher than 3 would automatically result in a loss if I were to win. Andy's bids have varied significantly, but there are instances where he bids very low (e.g., his bid of 5 in round 2). Therefore, to balance the risk of overbidding and still having a slim chance to win without losing, I will bid slightly above my perceived value. The bid of 4 minimizes potential loss if Andy's bid is unexpectedly low, while still being cautious about an overvaluation.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and considering my previous experiences where Andy's bids have ranged from 5 to 58 depending on his perceived value, it is essential to bid conservatively under these low perceived values. History suggests that a cautious bid around half my perceived value allows me a chance to win without significant risk of overpaying. Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly. Therefore, a bid of 10 continues to balance competitiveness against potential excessive loss if the common value is low.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for this round is 62. Analyzing the previous rounds, Andy's bids have varied widely between 3 and 58. I want to balance being competitive with ensuring that I don't overbid relative to the common value, which remains unknown. Bidding 40 gives me a reasonable chance to win, offering a buffer below my perceived value for potential profit while not being too aggressive given the variability in Andy's bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 55, and reflecting on previous bids where Andy's values have fluctuated, a bid of 40 seems to strike a balance. It is significantly below my perceived value, providing a good margin for profit if I win. This bid is competitive, yet conservative enough to avoid overpaying in case Andy's perceived value is much lower. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 36.

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49 this round, I want to strike a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overbidding. In the past rounds, I've seen Andy's bids ranging widely, from as low as 3 to as high as 58. To maximize my potential profit while avoiding excessive risk, a bid of 36 seems reasonable. This is well below my perceived value, allowing for a buffer to ensure potential profitability if I win, while still being competitive enough to possibly win against Andy's variable bid amounts.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In lower-value rounds, conservative bidding has minimized losses or led to fewer negative outcomes. To balance the chance of winning and minimizing potential losses, I will bid 4, as it falls in line with the observed strategy of cautious bidding for lower-value prizes, while still offering a chance to win the auction.'

In high-value rounds, competitive bids in the range of slightly below my perceived value, such as 45-58, have often yielded positive returns without overcommitting.

Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly. Therefore, a bid of 10 continues to balance competitiveness against potential excessive loss if the common value is low.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for this round is 62. Analyzing the previous rounds, Andy's bids have varied widely between 3 and 58. I want to balance being competitive with ensuring that I don't overbid relative to the common value, which remains unknown. Bidding 40 gives me a reasonable chance to win, offering a buffer below my perceived value for potential profit while not being too aggressive given the variability in Andy's bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 55, and reflecting on previous bids where Andy's values have fluctuated, a bid of 40 seems to strike a balance. It is significantly below my perceived value, providing a good margin for profit if I win. This bid is competitive, yet conservative enough to avoid overpaying in case Andy's perceived value is much lower. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49 this round, I want to strike a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overbidding. In the past rounds, I've seen Andy's bids ranging widely, from as low as 3 to as high as 58. To maximize my potential profit while avoiding excessive risk, a bid of 36 seems reasonable. This is well below my perceived value, allowing for a buffer to ensure potential profitability if I win, while still being competitive enough to possibly win against Andy's variable bid amounts.'

In high-value rounds, competitive bids in the range of slightly below my perceived value, such as 45-58, have often yielded positive returns without overcommitting. Given that bids from previous rounds for lower values have not greatly exceeded 50, bidding 47 should maximize my chance of winning while ensuring I don't overpay.'

Based on Andy's previous bidding behavior (bids of 45, 44, and 5), it seems that Andy's bids can vary widely depending on his perceived value. By bidding 34, I aim to reduce the risk of overbidding while still being competitive. This bid is 12 units below my perceived value, mitigating the loss if I overbid against Andy's lower value perception, and yet remains high enough to potentially win if Andy's bid is close to but below this amount.'

In round 2, I bid 20 when my value was 25, but Andy won with a bid of 5. This suggests that Andy's bids are sometimes significantly influenced by varying perceived values.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, and considering my previous experiences where Andy's bids have ranged from 5 to 58 depending on his perceived value, it is essential to bid conservatively under these low perceived values. History suggests that a cautious bid around half my perceived value allows me a chance to win without significant risk of overpaying. Therefore, a bid of 10 balances competitiveness while protecting against excessive loss if the common value of the prize is low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 4. The highest bidder won with a bid of 4 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 8, and considering Andy's previous erratic bids ranging from 3 to 58, I need to bid conservatively. In rounds where my perceived value was low, a cautious bid around half my value helped minimize losses and balance competitiveness. Hence, a bid of 4 is a strategic choice to keep potential losses minimal while having a chance to secure the prize if Andy's bid is low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I should bid conservatively to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds where my perceived value was low and conservative bids were placed (around half of my perceived value) helped minimize potential losses. This approach has been effective in balancing the risk and reward when Andy's bids vary significantly. Therefore, a bid of 10 continues to balance competitiveness against potential excessive loss if the common value is low.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for this round is 62. Analyzing the previous rounds, Andy's bids have varied widely between 3 and 58. I want to balance being competitive with ensuring that I don't overbid relative to the common value, which remains unknown. Bidding 40 gives me a reasonable chance to win, offering a buffer below my perceived value for potential profit while not being too aggressive given the variability in Andy's bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 55, and reflecting on previous bids where Andy's values have fluctuated, a bid of 40 seems to strike a balance. It is significantly below my perceived value, providing a good margin for profit if I win. This bid is competitive, yet conservative enough to avoid overpaying in case Andy's perceived value is much lower. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while minimizing risk.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49 this round, I want to strike a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overbidding. In the past rounds, I've seen Andy's bids ranging widely, from as low as 3 to as high as 58. To maximize my potential profit while avoiding excessive risk, a bid of 36 seems reasonable. This is well below my perceived value, allowing for a buffer to ensure potential profitability if I win, while still being competitive enough to possibly win against Andy's variable bid amounts.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 34, and considering Andy's variable bid history (ranging from 3 to 58), a bid of 22 strikes a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overbidding. This bid is sufficiently below my perceived value to ensure a buffer for potential profit, while still being competitive enough to have a chance to win.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my relatively high value of 90 this round and Andy's historically variable bids, bidding significantly below my perceived value provides a buffer for profit while still being competitive. Andy's past bids range broadly (3 to 58), so a bid of 60 is strategic. It balances potential for a high profit (if Andy bids lower) while not overcommitting if Andy's perceived value is unexpectedly high.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 67 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 63, I aim to bid less to maximize my potential profit while considering the likelihood of competition. In previous rounds, bids were 59 and 55, and 10 and 10. Therefore, a bid of 50 here balances taking a competitive stance without risking overbidding and losing profit if the prize value turns out to be close to my perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 6.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 71, I aim to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to maximize profit. From the history, I observe that bids have varied but typically remain competitive (e.g., 59 and 55 in round 0, 10 in round 1, and 65 and 50 in round 2). By bidding 61, I increase the likelihood of winning while still leaving room for a profit, considering that Betty's bids might also fall within a competitive but somewhat cautious range.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is only 5, it\u2019s crucial to mitigate the risk of overbidding. In previous rounds, strategies of bidding significantly lower than perceived values to ensure a potential profit have shown mixed results. For instance, high values justified higher bids, while modest values dictated cautious bets. Since 5 is quite low, bidding 3 minimizes potential loss while maintaining an outside chance of winning at a low cost.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 39 for the prize, I aim to bid sufficiently below my perceived value to ensure that winning still results in a profit. Looking at previous rounds, lower bids have sometimes led to winning, and considering the bid variability, 30 is a conservative yet competitive bid.

In previous rounds, bids were 59 and 55, and 10 and 10. Therefore, a bid of 50 here balances taking a competitive stance without risking overbidding and losing profit if the prize value turns out to be close to my perceived value.'

From the history, I observe that bids have varied but typically remain competitive (e.g., 59 and 55 in round 0, 10 in round 1, and 65 and 50 in round 2).

In previous rounds, strategies of bidding significantly lower than perceived values to ensure a potential profit have shown mixed results. For instance, high values justified higher bids, while modest values dictated cautious bets. Since 5 is quite low, bidding 3 minimizes potential loss while maintaining an outside chance of winning at a low cost.'

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 39 for the prize, I aim to bid sufficiently below my perceived value to ensure that winning still results in a profit. Looking at previous rounds, lower bids have sometimes led to winning, and considering the bid variability, 30 is a conservative yet competitive bid. This strategy maintains a balance between potentially winning and securing a profit if I do win.'

This bid is below my perceived value, providing a buffer for potential profit while acknowledging the risk of overbidding. Historical patterns where bids were closely matched (e.g., round 0 with 59 and 55, round 5 with 38 and 30) suggest a competitive yet cautious approach is prudent. By bidding 54, I keep a good chance of winning while still maximizing potential profit.'

This strategically positions me to outbid Andy, assuming his potential bid will be somewhat lower than 69, while maintaining a significant profit margin if I win based on the common value.'

This bid is below my perceived value, providing a buffer for potential profit while acknowledging the risk of overbidding. Historical patterns where bids were closely matched (e.g., round 0 with 59 and 55, round 5 with 38 and 30) suggest a competitive yet cautious approach is prudent.

However, since each round's values are redrawn independently, Andy's bid in this round is uncertain.

The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 69 and based on previous rounds where Andy's bids have varied but often aligned closely to his perceived value, I will bid 60. This strategically positions me to outbid Andy, assuming his potential bid will be somewhat lower than 69, while maintaining a significant profit margin if I win based on the common value.'

Thus, I will bid slightly below my perceived value of 43 to maximize profit while maintaining a competitive edge. By bidding 38, I aim to outbid Andy without excessively surpassing his potential bid, balancing my chances of winning and profitability based on the true common value.'

Therefore, by bidding 60, I aim to stay competitive while ensuring a significant margin for profit if I win based on the common value.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, Andy typically bids close to his perceived value, meaning his highest bid was 61, and his lowest was 20. This provides a range for his potential bids. Given my perceived value of 89, bidding 79 allows me to stay competitive without excessively surpassing Andy's possible bids, balancing the potential to win and maximizing profit while considering the independent redraw of values each round.'

In previous rounds, bids were 59 and 55, and 10 and 10.

From the history, I observe that bids have varied but typically remain competitive (e.g., 59 and 55 in round 0, 10 in round 1, and 65 and 50 in round 2).

In previous rounds, strategies of bidding significantly lower than perceived values to ensure a potential profit have shown mixed results.

This bid is below my perceived value, providing a buffer for potential profit while acknowledging the risk of overbidding. Historical patterns where bids were closely matched (e.g., round 0 with 59 and 55, round 5 with 38 and 30) suggest a competitive yet cautious approach is prudent.

Betty's bids have generally been close to the perceived values but on the lower side when her values were mid-range. For instance, in Round 0 my bid of 59 won against a 55, and in Round 3 my bid of 61 won against 60. A bid of 60 aims to balance competitiveness and potential profit without overcommitting.'

For example, in Round 0, I won with a bid of 59 against a bid of 55. Similarly, in Round 3, my bid of 61 won against 60.

Thus, I will bid slightly below my perceived value of 43 to maximize profit while maintaining a competitive edge. By bidding 38, I aim to outbid Andy without excessively surpassing his potential bid, balancing my chances of winning and profitability based on the true common value.'

Therefore, by bidding 60, I aim to stay competitive while ensuring a significant margin for profit if I win based on the common value. This strategy balances risk and reward effectively based on our historical bidding patterns.'

By bidding slightly below my perceived value of 44, I aim to outbid Andy without excessively surpassing his potential bid. This strategy balances my chances of winning and profitability based on the true common value, while taking into account the variability of Andy's bids and the independently redrawn values each round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 89, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 13.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, Andy typically bids close to his perceived value, meaning his highest bid was 61, and his lowest was 20. This provides a range for his potential bids. Given my perceived value of 89, bidding 79 allows me to stay competitive without excessively surpassing Andy's possible bids, balancing the potential to win and maximizing profit while considering the independent redraw of values each round.'

To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I should bid conservatively. Bidding 10 positions me competitively without risking an overbid, considering the independently redrawn values each round and Andy's previous bid range.'

In previous rounds, bids were 59 and 55, and 10 and 10. Therefore, a bid of 50 here balances taking a competitive stance without risking overbidding and losing profit if the prize value turns out to be close to my perceived value.'

From the history, I observe that bids have varied but typically remain competitive (e.g., 59 and 55 in round 0, 10 in round 1, and 65 and 50 in round 2).

In previous rounds, strategies of bidding significantly lower than perceived values to ensure a potential profit have shown mixed results. For instance, high values justified higher bids, while modest values dictated cautious bets.

Looking at previous rounds, lower bids have sometimes led to winning, and considering the bid variability, 30 is a conservative yet competitive bid.

This bid is below my perceived value, providing a buffer for potential profit while acknowledging the risk of overbidding. Historical patterns where bids were closely matched (e.g., round 0 with 59 and 55, round 5 with 38 and 30) suggest a competitive yet cautious approach is prudent.

However, for lower perceived values, keeping a conservative bid has often been beneficial. A bid of 20 balances the likelihood of winning while ensuring that I do not overcommit since the common value may still be below my perceived value.'

The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 74 towards the prize, and observing the past bidding patterns, I'd aim to bid slightly lower to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive. Betty's bids have generally been close to the perceived values but on the lower side when her values were mid-range. For instance, in Round 0 my bid of 59 won against a 55, and in Round 3 my bid of 61 won against 60. A bid of 60 aims to balance competitiveness and potential profit without overcommitting.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 60 and observing the history of past rounds, I want to maximize my profit while remaining competitive. Typically, bidding slightly lower than my perceived value has been a prudent approach since bids have often been competitive but not excessively high. For example, in Round 0, I won with a bid of 59 against a bid of 55. Similarly, in Round 3, my bid of 61 won against 60. Therefore, a bid of 50 should strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a competitive bid.'

Historical data show that bids slightly below the perceived value often yield good outcomes. For instance, in previous rounds with similar values, bidding lower helped mitigate risks while maintaining a chance to win. A bid of 50 balances the potential for profit and the likelihood of winning without overcommitting.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 66 and analyzing the previous rounds, it\u2019s evident that Andy bids close to his perceived value. Therefore, by bidding 60, I aim to stay competitive while ensuring a significant margin for profit if I win based on the common value. This strategy balances risk and reward effectively based on our historical bidding patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, Andy typically bids close to his perceived value, meaning his highest bid was 61, and his lowest was 20. This provides a range for his potential bids. Given my perceived value of 89, bidding 79 allows me to stay competitive without excessively surpassing Andy's possible bids, balancing the potential to win and maximizing profit while considering the independent redraw of values each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 14 this round and analyzing Andy's bidding pattern from previous rounds, he tends to bid close to his perceived value. To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I should bid conservatively. Bidding 10 positions me competitively without risking an overbid, considering the independently redrawn values each round and Andy's previous bid range.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 50.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 68, and based on previous rounds where Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value, bidding 60 balances competitiveness and profitability. This strategy aims to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid, leveraging independent redraws each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 50.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 64 for this round and analyzing previous rounds where Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value, bidding 58 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while not overly surpassing potential bids from Andy, thus balancing my chances of winning and maximizing my profit given the independently redrawn values each round.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 37. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20.

In previous rounds, bids were 59 and 55, and 10 and 10. Therefore, a bid of 50 here balances taking a competitive stance without risking overbidding and losing profit if the prize value turns out to be close to my perceived value.'

From the history, I observe that bids have varied but typically remain competitive (e.g., 59 and 55 in round 0, 10 in round 1, and 65 and 50 in round 2). By bidding 61, I increase the likelihood of winning while still leaving room for a profit, considering that Betty's bids might also fall within a competitive but somewhat cautious range.'

In previous rounds, strategies of bidding significantly lower than perceived values to ensure a potential profit have shown mixed results. For instance, high values justified higher bids, while modest values dictated cautious bets.

Looking at previous rounds, lower bids have sometimes led to winning, and considering the bid variability, 30 is a conservative yet competitive bid.

This bid is below my perceived value, providing a buffer for potential profit while acknowledging the risk of overbidding. Historical patterns where bids were closely matched (e.g., round 0 with 59 and 55, round 5 with 38 and 30) suggest a competitive yet cautious approach is prudent.

However, for lower perceived values, keeping a conservative bid has often been beneficial. A bid of 20 balances the likelihood of winning while ensuring that I do not overcommit since the common value may still be below my perceived value.'

The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 74 towards the prize, and observing the past bidding patterns, I'd aim to bid slightly lower to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive. Betty's bids have generally been close to the perceived values but on the lower side when her values were mid-range. For instance, in Round 0 my bid of 59 won against a 55, and in Round 3 my bid of 61 won against 60. A bid of 60 aims to balance competitiveness and potential profit without overcommitting.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 6, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 60 and observing the history of past rounds, I want to maximize my profit while remaining competitive. Typically, bidding slightly lower than my perceived value has been a prudent approach since bids have often been competitive but not excessively high. For example, in Round 0, I won with a bid of 59 against a bid of 55. Similarly, in Round 3, my bid of 61 won against 60. Therefore, a bid of 50 should strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a competitive bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 50.

Historical data show that bids slightly below the perceived value often yield good outcomes. For instance, in previous rounds with similar values, bidding lower helped mitigate risks while maintaining a chance to win. A bid of 50 balances the potential for profit and the likelihood of winning without overcommitting.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20.

For instance, in Round 7, where my perceived value was 30, I bid 20, although I did not win, it was a prudent bid. Hence, to maximize potential profit while staying competitive, a bid of 20 seems appropriate without overcommitting.'

In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 54. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 54. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 66 and analyzing the previous rounds, it\u2019s evident that Andy bids close to his perceived value. Therefore, by bidding 60, I aim to stay competitive while ensuring a significant margin for profit if I win based on the common value. This strategy balances risk and reward effectively based on our historical bidding patterns.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 6.\\nYour total profit is 21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value. By bidding slightly below my perceived value of 44, I aim to outbid Andy without excessively surpassing his potential bid. This strategy balances my chances of winning and profitability based on the true common value, while taking into account the variability of Andy's bids and the independently redrawn values each round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 89, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 13.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, Andy typically bids close to his perceived value, meaning his highest bid was 61, and his lowest was 20. This provides a range for his potential bids. Given my perceived value of 89, bidding 79 allows me to stay competitive without excessively surpassing Andy's possible bids, balancing the potential to win and maximizing profit while considering the independent redraw of values each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 14 this round and analyzing Andy's bidding pattern from previous rounds, he tends to bid close to his perceived value. To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I should bid conservatively. Bidding 10 positions me competitively without risking an overbid, considering the independently redrawn values each round and Andy's previous bid range.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 68, and based on previous rounds where Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value, bidding 60 balances competitiveness and profitability. This strategy aims to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid, leveraging independent redraws each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 64 for this round and analyzing previous rounds where Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value, bidding 58 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while not overly surpassing potential bids from Andy, thus balancing my chances of winning and maximizing my profit given the independently redrawn values each round.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 37. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 41 and the patterns from previous rounds where Andy tends to bid close to his perceived value, bidding 35 strategically positions me to win the auction without excessively surpassing Andy's potential bid. This approach balances competitiveness and profitability, taking into account the independently redrawn values each round.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 73 this round and the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it's clear that Andy often bids close to his perceived value. By bidding 65, I aim to stay competitive while not excessively surpassing Andy's potential bid, thus maximizing my chances of winning and achieving a significant profit margin based on the common value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 89 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In the second round, when I had a lower value, I bid conservatively. Given my value now is 61, which is quite high, I want to bid more aggressively than 30 but not so high that I risk overbidding significantly. Based on the history, Andy's bids have been 23 and 18. By bidding 38, I increase my chances of wining without excessively cutting into my profit margin, assuming Andy bids in a similar range.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, my perceived total value has varied significantly, and Andy's bids have ranged from 18 to 23. Given my current value of 13, I need to bid cautiously to avoid overbidding but still stand a chance to win. Since I aim to maximize my total profit, bidding 8 provides a balance between not losing too much potential profit and having a small possibility of beating Andy if his value and bid are exceptionally low this round.'

Looking at the history, Andy's highest bid has been 23. Therefore, bidding 50 should give me a strong chance of winning while leaving a good profit margin. Even if Andy bids higher than his usual, I should still win but not overpay excessively.'

Considering my perceived value of 58 this round, I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy without excessively cutting into my profit. A bid of 36 places me above Andy's average bidding range based on historical data while leaving room for a comfortable profit if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 16. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 32 for the prize, I need to consider both Andy's past bidding behavior and my need to maximize profit. In previous rounds, Andy's bids ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 42, with an average bid around 25-30. To balance my risk and potential profit, I will bid 20, which is moderately aggressive given my lower value this round. This strategy aims to outbid Andy safely while ensuring that I don't overbid, considering the relative value of the prize.'

Since my value for the prize is 61, bidding 30 gives me a potential profit margin while considering I may need to outbid Andy but still win at a reasonable cost if his value or bid is lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 15, I'm bidding 10 to minimize potential losses. Given that the highest profit in the first round was 21 (from bidding 30 against 23), I'm adopting a cautious strategy to avoid overbidding and to account for the possibility of a low common value having a significant effect on profitability.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 21.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the first round, I bid 30 and ended up with a profit of 21. In the second round, when I had a lower value, I bid conservatively. Given my value now is 61, which is quite high, I want to bid more aggressively than 30 but not so high that I risk overbidding significantly. Based on the history, Andy's bids have been 23 and 18. By bidding 38, I increase my chances of wining without excessively cutting into my profit margin, assuming Andy bids in a similar range.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 42. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, my perceived total value has varied significantly, and Andy's bids have ranged from 18 to 23. Given my current value of 13, I need to bid cautiously to avoid overbidding but still stand a chance to win. Since I aim to maximize my total profit, bidding 8 provides a balance between not losing too much potential profit and having a small possibility of beating Andy if his value and bid are exceptionally low this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 79, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 37.\\nYour total profit is 79. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 37.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high compared to previous rounds, I want to bid more aggressively than in previous rounds to secure the prize. Looking at the history, Andy's highest bid has been 23. Therefore, bidding 50 should give me a strong chance of winning while leaving a good profit margin. Even if Andy bids higher than his usual, I should still win but not overpay excessively.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 24.\\nYour total profit is 103. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 24.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my careful review of previous rounds, Andy's bids have ranged between 18 and 42. Considering my perceived value of 58 this round, I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy without excessively cutting into my profit. A bid of 36 places me above Andy's average bidding range based on historical data while leaving room for a comfortable profit if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 14, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 101. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 16. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 16. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 32 for the prize, I need to consider both Andy's past bidding behavior and my need to maximize profit. In previous rounds, Andy's bids ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 42, with an average bid around 25-30. To balance my risk and potential profit, I will bid 20, which is moderately aggressive given my lower value this round. This strategy aims to outbid Andy safely while ensuring that I don't overbid, considering the relative value of the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 32.\\nYour total profit is 133. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids have ranged between 10 and 42, with a tendency to bid higher for perceived higher values. Given my value for this round is 67, I want to bid aggressively enough to secure the prize while leaving a reasonable profit margin. A bid of 40 places me above Andy's average bid range, thus increasing my chances of winning while ensuring a potential profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 133. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my value of 21 for this round and the historical data of Andy's bids, which have varied from 10 to 42, I aim to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for profit. Given my relatively low perceived value, a cautious bid of 12 allows me to remain competitive without overcommitting, considering the ultimately uncertain common value and Andy's bid range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 148. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 and based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids generally range from 10 to 42 with occasional higher bids when his perceived value is likely higher. I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy while maintaining a good profit margin.

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 42. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, my perceived total value has varied significantly, and Andy's bids have ranged from 18 to 23. Given my current value of 13, I need to bid cautiously to avoid overbidding but still stand a chance to win. Since I aim to maximize my total profit, bidding 8 provides a balance between not losing too much potential profit and having a small possibility of beating Andy if his value and bid are exceptionally low this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 79, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 37.\\nYour total profit is 79. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 37.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high compared to previous rounds, I want to bid more aggressively than in previous rounds to secure the prize. Looking at the history, Andy's highest bid has been 23. Therefore, bidding 50 should give me a strong chance of winning while leaving a good profit margin. Even if Andy bids higher than his usual, I should still win but not overpay excessively.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 24.\\nYour total profit is 103. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 24.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my careful review of previous rounds, Andy's bids have ranged between 18 and 42. Considering my perceived value of 58 this round, I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy without excessively cutting into my profit. A bid of 36 places me above Andy's average bidding range based on historical data while leaving room for a comfortable profit if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 14, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 101. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 16. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 16. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 32 for the prize, I need to consider both Andy's past bidding behavior and my need to maximize profit. In previous rounds, Andy's bids ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 42, with an average bid around 25-30. To balance my risk and potential profit, I will bid 20, which is moderately aggressive given my lower value this round. This strategy aims to outbid Andy safely while ensuring that I don't overbid, considering the relative value of the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 32.\\nYour total profit is 133. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 34. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids have ranged between 10 and 42, with a tendency to bid higher for perceived higher values. Given my value for this round is 67, I want to bid aggressively enough to secure the prize while leaving a reasonable profit margin. A bid of 40 places me above Andy's average bid range, thus increasing my chances of winning while ensuring a potential profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 133. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my value of 21 for this round and the historical data of Andy's bids, which have varied from 10 to 42, I aim to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for profit. Given my relatively low perceived value, a cautious bid of 12 allows me to remain competitive without overcommitting, considering the ultimately uncertain common value and Andy's bid range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 148. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 and based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids generally range from 10 to 42 with occasional higher bids when his perceived value is likely higher. I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy while maintaining a good profit margin. A bid of 35 places me above the midpoint of Andy's typical range and provides a strong chance of winning without significantly cutting into my potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 38.\\nYour total profit is 186. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high, and based on the historical bidding patterns of Andy, the prudent bid would be somewhat aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Andy's bids in previous rounds have shown a tendency to range between 10 and 42.

Given my value for this round is 67, I want to bid aggressively enough to secure the prize while leaving a reasonable profit margin. A bid of 40 places me above Andy's average bid range, thus increasing my chances of winning while ensuring a potential profit if I win.'

Given my relatively low perceived value, a cautious bid of 12 allows me to remain competitive without overcommitting, considering the ultimately uncertain common value and Andy's bid range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 148. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 and based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids generally range from 10 to 42 with occasional higher bids when his perceived value is likely higher. I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy while maintaining a good profit margin. A bid of 35 places me above the midpoint of Andy's typical range and provides a strong chance of winning without significantly cutting into my potential profit.'

The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high, and based on the historical bidding patterns of Andy, the prudent bid would be somewhat aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Andy's bids in previous rounds have shown a tendency to range between 10 and 42. Bidding 48 places me in a strong position to secure the prize without excessively diminishing my profit margin.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 and based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids generally range from 10 to 42 with occasional higher bids when his perceived value is likely higher. I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy while maintaining a good profit margin. A bid of 35 places me above the midpoint of Andy's typical range and provides a strong chance of winning without significantly cutting into my potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 38.\\nYour total profit is 186. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high, and based on the historical bidding patterns of Andy, the prudent bid would be somewhat aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Andy's bids in previous rounds have shown a tendency to range between 10 and 42. Bidding 48 places me in a strong position to secure the prize without excessively diminishing my profit margin.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 198. \\nAll the bids for this round were 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 22 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical data, Andy's bids typically range between 10 and 42. Given my value of 40 for this round, I want to bid enough to outbid Andy but still maintain a good profit margin. A bid of 22 provides a higher probability of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin in case Andy bids near the higher end of his typical range.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 198. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 9 for this round, I need to bid very cautiously to avoid overbidding. Historically, Andy's bids have ranged from 10 to 42, with lower bids occasionally below 10. To maximize my total profit while being mindful of my low perceived value, I will bid 5.

In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 148. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 and based on the history of previous rounds, Andy's bids generally range from 10 to 42 with occasional higher bids when his perceived value is likely higher. I aim to bid high enough to outbid Andy while maintaining a good profit margin. A bid of 35 places me above the midpoint of Andy's typical range and provides a strong chance of winning without significantly cutting into my potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 38.\\nYour total profit is 186. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 86, which is quite high, and based on the historical bidding patterns of Andy, the prudent bid would be somewhat aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. Andy's bids in previous rounds have shown a tendency to range between 10 and 42. Bidding 48 places me in a strong position to secure the prize without excessively diminishing my profit margin.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 198. \\nAll the bids for this round were 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 22 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical data, Andy's bids typically range between 10 and 42. Given my value of 40 for this round, I want to bid enough to outbid Andy but still maintain a good profit margin. A bid of 22 provides a higher probability of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin in case Andy bids near the higher end of his typical range.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 198. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 9 for this round, I need to bid very cautiously to avoid overbidding. Historically, Andy's bids have ranged from 10 to 42, with lower bids occasionally below 10. To maximize my total profit while being mindful of my low perceived value, I will bid 5. This approach minimizes my risk of loss if Andy bids low, and I don't win with a high bid over my perceived value.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 31.\\nYour total profit is 229. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for this round and based on the historical patterns of Andy's bids, which have ranged from 10 to 42, bidding 47 places me in a strong position to secure the prize. This assumes Andy might bid near his higher range if his perceived value is also high. By bidding 47, I aim to strike a balance between being aggressive enough to win and maintaining a reasonable profit margin if I succeed.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 48 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive. A bid of 35 seems like a strategic choice to potentially win the auction while maximizing profit by avoiding overbidding, considering the possible range of Betty's bid.'

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value.

The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 44 for this round, I want to place a bid that maximizes my profit without overbidding. Based on the scenario, an optimal bidding strategy typically involves bidding a little below my perceived value to account for the second-highest bid payment structure. In this case, 29 seems like a strategic bid as it is sufficiently low to avoid negative profits but high enough to potentially win the auction, assuming Betty's value varies similarly to mine.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 18.

The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that the second-highest bids were 14 and 18, respectively, which suggests that Betty's bids tend to be cautiously lower than the perceived values. Given my value of 55 for this round, I want to maximize my profit without overbidding. Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive. A bid of 35 seems like a strategic choice to potentially win the auction while maximizing profit by avoiding overbidding, considering the possible range of Betty's bid.'

From previous rounds, I have learned that Betty\u2019s bids tend to be higher than my perceived value in this case.

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value. This strategy balances the likelihood of winning with a reasonable payment and the potential profit based on the common value and the auction structure.'

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the previous rounds, my strategy has consistently been to bid below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Betty's bids tend to be reasonably cautious. Given my value of 54, a bid of 37 is strategically placed to potentially win while maintaining a significant margin for profit. This takes into account the likelihood of Betty's bid being lower than mine and still aiming to keep the payment from the second-highest bid controlled.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 9 for this round, I should consider previous trends in bidding to maximize my profit. Betty's bids in past rounds have tended to be somewhat conservative in similar situations, often around mid-range values when compared to high perceived values. In this case, placing a bid of 5 balances the risk of overbidding and potential losses while still allowing a chance to potentially win should Betty's bid be lower. Since values and outcomes vary independently each round, this moderate bid helps optimize my profit while minimizing risk.'

Based on the scenario, an optimal bidding strategy typically involves bidding a little below my perceived value to account for the second-highest bid payment structure. In this case, 29 seems like a strategic bid as it is sufficiently low to avoid negative profits but high enough to potentially win the auction, assuming Betty's value varies similarly to mine.'

My current value for the prize this round is 40. To maximize my profit, I should bid a bit lower than my perceived value, considering the likely range of Betty's bid. Given the typical variance and aiming to avoid overbidding, 25 seems like a strategic choice to potentially win the auction with maximum profit while keeping the bid competitive.'

Given my value of 55 for this round, I want to maximize my profit without overbidding. Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive. A bid of 35 seems like a strategic choice to potentially win the auction while maximizing profit by avoiding overbidding, considering the possible range of Betty's bid.'

From previous rounds, I have learned that Betty\u2019s bids tend to be higher than my perceived value in this case. To minimize potential losses, I will place a minimal bid of 1, knowing that it is unlikely I will win, but it also avoids overbidding and potential negative profit.'

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value. This strategy balances the likelihood of winning with a reasonable payment and the potential profit based on the common value and the auction structure.'

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the previous rounds, my strategy has consistently been to bid below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Betty's bids tend to be reasonably cautious. Given my value of 54, a bid of 37 is strategically placed to potentially win while maintaining a significant margin for profit. This takes into account the likelihood of Betty's bid being lower than mine and still aiming to keep the payment from the second-highest bid controlled.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 46. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10.

Betty's bids in past rounds have tended to be somewhat conservative in similar situations, often around mid-range values when compared to high perceived values. In this case, placing a bid of 5 balances the risk of overbidding and potential losses while still allowing a chance to potentially win should Betty's bid be lower. Since values and outcomes vary independently each round, this moderate bid helps optimize my profit while minimizing risk.'

Based on previous rounds, Betty\u2019s bids tend to be higher than what would make sense for me to bid in this case, thus I will place a minimal bid of 1.

My strategy is to bid roughly half of my perceived value, around 9, to balance the risk of overbidding while maximizing potential profit if I win the auction.

In previous rounds, Andy bid 29 and 25. To effectively outbid Andy without significantly reducing my profit, I will bid just above his highest bid so far. Hence, I choose to bid 31.

Andy tends to bid in the higher ranges, so by bidding 9, I minimize my potential loss while keeping the chance to win if Andy significantly underbids.'

Andy's bids have shown variations, but generally stayed below my current perceived value. In prior rounds, Andy bid 29, 25, 35, 1, and 12.

Andy's bids have fluctuated (29, 25, 35, 1, 12, 37), indicating both high and low bidding tendencies. To maximize profit without overpaying drastically, I opt to bid conservatively at 10. This should provide a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a favorable profit margin if I win.'

The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 28 and my goal is to maximize profit, I plan to bid lower to ensure a favorable payoff. Assuming Bidder Andy's value could be similar or different, bidding half my value (14) could maximize my chance of winning while ensuring a positive net gain if I win, considering the typical range of bids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 31. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 61, I want to maximize my profit while considering past bidding patterns. In previous rounds, Andy bid 29 and 25. To effectively outbid Andy without significantly reducing my profit, I will bid just above his highest bid so far. Hence, I choose to bid 31. This strategy increases the likelihood of winning the prize while keeping my payment close to previous winning bid ranges.'

Andy tends to bid in the higher ranges, so by bidding 9, I minimize my potential loss while keeping the chance to win if Andy significantly underbids.'

Andy's bids have shown variations, but generally stayed below my current perceived value. In prior rounds, Andy bid 29, 25, 35, 1, and 12. To balance the need to win without overpaying, I'll place a bid that is roughly half my perceived value. This should give me a good chance of winning while ensuring a robust profit if I do.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 this round, my goal is to bid strategically to maximize profit while considering Andy's past bidding behavior. Andy's bids have fluctuated (29, 25, 35, 1, 12, 37), indicating both high and low bidding tendencies. To maximize profit without overpaying drastically, I opt to bid conservatively at 10. This should provide a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a favorable profit margin if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 9, and reviewing past rounds where Andy has placed both high and low bids, I will bid conservatively. By bidding 5, I minimize potential loss while still having a chance to win if Andy bids very low. This approach balances risk and potential profit by maintaining a cautious stance based on previous patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 23 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by strategically bidding. Andy's previous bids have varied significantly but have often been above the perceived values I have experienced. However, Andy's lowest winning bid so far was 1. By bidding 12, I balance the chance of winning without overpaying, considering Andy's occasional low bids and my perceived value. This approach ensures a reasonable chance to win while maintaining a good profit margin if successful.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37 this round, I aim to balance out the likelihood of winning and maintaining maximum profit. Andy's bids have ranged from very low bids (1) to high bids (37). Given this information, a bid of 19 is half of my perceived value and is strategically placed to potentially outbid Andy on his lower bids while not overpaying if his bids trend higher. This approach aims to achieve a good balance between winning the bid and preserving a high profit margin if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 33.

Noting that Andy's bids have ranged from 1 to 37, setting my bid at half of my perceived value, 33, strikes a balance between sufficiently outbidding Andy on lower bids while maintaining a high profit margin if I win.

Based on the scenario, an optimal bidding strategy typically involves bidding a little below my perceived value to account for the second-highest bid payment structure. In this case, 29 seems like a strategic bid as it is sufficiently low to avoid negative profits but high enough to potentially win the auction, assuming Betty's value varies similarly to mine.'

Given my value of 55 for this round, I want to maximize my profit without overbidding. Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive.

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value.

Betty's bids in past rounds have tended to be somewhat conservative in similar situations, often around mid-range values when compared to high perceived values. In this case, placing a bid of 5 balances the risk of overbidding and potential losses while still allowing a chance to potentially win should Betty's bid be lower. Since values and outcomes vary independently each round, this moderate bid helps optimize my profit while minimizing risk.'

My strategy is to bid roughly half of my perceived value, around 9, to balance the risk of overbidding while maximizing potential profit if I win the auction. Placing a bid lower than my perceived value helps ensure that my profit is maximized, based on the payment of the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 44. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 19.

In earlier rounds with similar perceived values, cautious and strategic bids around half of the perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 20 strikes a balance between competitiveness and the potential for maximizing profit based on the second-highest bid likely being lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 14. The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 28 and my goal is to maximize profit, I plan to bid lower to ensure a favorable payoff. Assuming Bidder Andy's value could be similar or different, bidding half my value (14) could maximize my chance of winning while ensuring a positive net gain if I win, considering the typical range of bids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 18. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 35 and learning from the previous round where Andy bid 29, I need to increase my bid to have a better chance of winning without overbidding significantly. By bidding 18, I balance the chance of winning with a favorable payoff considering the typical bid range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 31. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 61, I want to maximize my profit while considering past bidding patterns. In previous rounds, Andy bid 29 and 25. To effectively outbid Andy without significantly reducing my profit, I will bid just above his highest bid so far. Hence, I choose to bid 31. This strategy increases the likelihood of winning the prize while keeping my payment close to previous winning bid ranges.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round and considering the previous rounds where Andy's bids were 29, 25, and 35, a lower bid might be a safer strategy to maximize my profit. Andy tends to bid in the higher ranges, so by bidding 9, I minimize my potential loss while keeping the chance to win if Andy significantly underbids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 this round, I aim to balance my bid to increase the likelihood of winning without overpaying significantly. Analyzing the past bid dynamics where Andy bid 29, 25, 35, and 1, a bid of 20 can potentially outbid Andy if he bids conservatively while ensuring my payment is still less than my perceived value, maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 37 and paid 23. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to maximize my profit while considering previous bidding patterns. Andy's bids have shown variations, but generally stayed below my current perceived value. In prior rounds, Andy bid 29, 25, 35, 1, and 12. To balance the need to win without overpaying, I'll place a bid that is roughly half my perceived value. This should give me a good chance of winning while ensuring a robust profit if I do.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 this round, my goal is to bid strategically to maximize profit while considering Andy's past bidding behavior. Andy's bids have fluctuated (29, 25, 35, 1, 12, 37), indicating both high and low bidding tendencies. To maximize profit without overpaying drastically, I opt to bid conservatively at 10. This should provide a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a favorable profit margin if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 9, and reviewing past rounds where Andy has placed both high and low bids, I will bid conservatively. By bidding 5, I minimize potential loss while still having a chance to win if Andy bids very low. This approach balances risk and potential profit by maintaining a cautious stance based on previous patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 23 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by strategically bidding. Andy's previous bids have varied significantly but have often been above the perceived values I have experienced. However, Andy's lowest winning bid so far was 1. By bidding 12, I balance the chance of winning without overpaying, considering Andy's occasional low bids and my perceived value. This approach ensures a reasonable chance to win while maintaining a good profit margin if successful.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37 this round, I aim to balance out the likelihood of winning and maintaining maximum profit. Andy's bids have ranged from very low bids (1) to high bids (37). Given this information, a bid of 19 is half of my perceived value and is strategically placed to potentially outbid Andy on his lower bids while not overpaying if his bids trend higher. This approach aims to achieve a good balance between winning the bid and preserving a high profit margin if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by considering the history of previous rounds. Noting that Andy's bids have ranged from 1 to 37, setting my bid at half of my perceived value, 33, strikes a balance between sufficiently outbidding Andy on lower bids while maintaining a high profit margin if I win. This approach also mitigates the risk of overpaying in cases where Andy bids high.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 11.

Based on the scenario, an optimal bidding strategy typically involves bidding a little below my perceived value to account for the second-highest bid payment structure. In this case, 29 seems like a strategic bid as it is sufficiently low to avoid negative profits but high enough to potentially win the auction, assuming Betty's value varies similarly to mine.'

Given my value of 55 for this round, I want to maximize my profit without overbidding. Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive.

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value. This strategy balances the likelihood of winning with a reasonable payment and the potential profit based on the common value and the auction structure.'

Betty's bids in past rounds have tended to be somewhat conservative in similar situations, often around mid-range values when compared to high perceived values. In this case, placing a bid of 5 balances the risk of overbidding and potential losses while still allowing a chance to potentially win should Betty's bid be lower. Since values and outcomes vary independently each round, this moderate bid helps optimize my profit while minimizing risk.'

My strategy is to bid roughly half of my perceived value, around 9, to balance the risk of overbidding while maximizing potential profit if I win the auction. Placing a bid lower than my perceived value helps ensure that my profit is maximized, based on the payment of the second-highest bid.'

In earlier rounds with similar perceived values, cautious and strategic bids around half of the perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 20 strikes a balance between competitiveness and the potential for maximizing profit based on the second-highest bid likely being lower.'

To maximize my profit for this round with a perceived value of 50, I will strategically place a bid that is well below my perceived value but still competitive. Bidding 33 strikes a balance by being aggressive enough to potentially win while minimizing the payment to the second-highest bid, thereby maximizing profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 14. The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 28 and my goal is to maximize profit, I plan to bid lower to ensure a favorable payoff. Assuming Bidder Andy's value could be similar or different, bidding half my value (14) could maximize my chance of winning while ensuring a positive net gain if I win, considering the typical range of bids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 18. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 35 and learning from the previous round where Andy bid 29, I need to increase my bid to have a better chance of winning without overbidding significantly. By bidding 18, I balance the chance of winning with a favorable payoff considering the typical bid range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 31. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 61, I want to maximize my profit while considering past bidding patterns. In previous rounds, Andy bid 29 and 25. To effectively outbid Andy without significantly reducing my profit, I will bid just above his highest bid so far. Hence, I choose to bid 31. This strategy increases the likelihood of winning the prize while keeping my payment close to previous winning bid ranges.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round and considering the previous rounds where Andy's bids were 29, 25, and 35, a lower bid might be a safer strategy to maximize my profit. Andy tends to bid in the higher ranges, so by bidding 9, I minimize my potential loss while keeping the chance to win if Andy significantly underbids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 this round, I aim to balance my bid to increase the likelihood of winning without overpaying significantly. Analyzing the past bid dynamics where Andy bid 29, 25, 35, and 1, a bid of 20 can potentially outbid Andy if he bids conservatively while ensuring my payment is still less than my perceived value, maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 37 and paid 23. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to maximize my profit while considering previous bidding patterns. Andy's bids have shown variations, but generally stayed below my current perceived value. In prior rounds, Andy bid 29, 25, 35, 1, and 12. To balance the need to win without overpaying, I'll place a bid that is roughly half my perceived value. This should give me a good chance of winning while ensuring a robust profit if I do.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 this round, my goal is to bid strategically to maximize profit while considering Andy's past bidding behavior. Andy's bids have fluctuated (29, 25, 35, 1, 12, 37), indicating both high and low bidding tendencies. To maximize profit without overpaying drastically, I opt to bid conservatively at 10. This should provide a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a favorable profit margin if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 9, and reviewing past rounds where Andy has placed both high and low bids, I will bid conservatively. By bidding 5, I minimize potential loss while still having a chance to win if Andy bids very low. This approach balances risk and potential profit by maintaining a cautious stance based on previous patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 23 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by strategically bidding. Andy's previous bids have varied significantly but have often been above the perceived values I have experienced. However, Andy's lowest winning bid so far was 1. By bidding 12, I balance the chance of winning without overpaying, considering Andy's occasional low bids and my perceived value. This approach ensures a reasonable chance to win while maintaining a good profit margin if successful.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37 this round, I aim to balance out the likelihood of winning and maintaining maximum profit. Andy's bids have ranged from very low bids (1) to high bids (37). Given this information, a bid of 19 is half of my perceived value and is strategically placed to potentially outbid Andy on his lower bids while not overpaying if his bids trend higher. This approach aims to achieve a good balance between winning the bid and preserving a high profit margin if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by considering the history of previous rounds. Noting that Andy's bids have ranged from 1 to 37, setting my bid at half of my perceived value, 33, strikes a balance between sufficiently outbidding Andy on lower bids while maintaining a high profit margin if I win. This approach also mitigates the risk of overpaying in cases where Andy bids high.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 11.

This strategy balances the chance of winning while ensuring I don't overpay, taking into account that values are redrawn independently each round. This approach should maximize my profit by maintaining a good potential return if I win without excessively high exposure to loss if Andy bids low.'

Based on the scenario, an optimal bidding strategy typically involves bidding a little below my perceived value to account for the second-highest bid payment structure. In this case, 29 seems like a strategic bid as it is sufficiently low to avoid negative profits but high enough to potentially win the auction, assuming Betty's value varies similarly to mine.'

Given my value of 55 for this round, I want to maximize my profit without overbidding. Since the values are redrawn independently, I will select a bid that is well below my perceived value to allow profit while still being competitive.

For example, her bids have varied but stayed within a reasonable range below my bids, and the second-highest bids could indicate a cautious strategy. To maximize my profit without overbidding, I will bid 12, which is half of my perceived value.

Betty's bids in past rounds have tended to be somewhat conservative in similar situations, often around mid-range values when compared to high perceived values. In this case, placing a bid of 5 balances the risk of overbidding and potential losses while still allowing a chance to potentially win should Betty's bid be lower. Since values and outcomes vary independently each round, this moderate bid helps optimize my profit while minimizing risk.'

In earlier rounds with similar perceived values, cautious and strategic bids around half of the perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 20 strikes a balance between competitiveness and the potential for maximizing profit based on the second-highest bid likely being lower.'

Bidding around 64 could be too high considering the payment structure, so a more strategic approach is to bid lower to maximize potential profit while still being competitive. Based on my previous successful bids and Betty\u2019s patterns of cautious bidding, bidding 41 should balance the competitiveness and the risk of paying too much with the second-highest bid.'

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 86', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 14. The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 28 and my goal is to maximize profit, I plan to bid lower to ensure a favorable payoff. Assuming Bidder Andy's value could be similar or different, bidding half my value (14) could maximize my chance of winning while ensuring a positive net gain if I win, considering the typical range of bids.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 18. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 35 and learning from the previous round where Andy bid 29, I need to increase my bid to have a better chance of winning without overbidding significantly. By bidding 18, I balance the chance of winning with a favorable payoff considering the typical bid range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 31, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 31. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 31. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 61, I want to maximize my profit while considering past bidding patterns. In previous rounds, Andy bid 29 and 25. To effectively outbid Andy without significantly reducing my profit, I will bid just above his highest bid so far. Hence, I choose to bid 31. This strategy increases the likelihood of winning the prize while keeping my payment close to previous winning bid ranges.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round and considering the previous rounds where Andy's bids were 29, 25, and 35, a lower bid might be a safer strategy to maximize my profit. Andy tends to bid in the higher ranges, so by bidding 9, I minimize my potential loss while keeping the chance to win if Andy significantly underbids.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 6.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 this round, I aim to balance my bid to increase the likelihood of winning without overpaying significantly. Analyzing the past bid dynamics where Andy bid 29, 25, 35, and 1, a bid of 20 can potentially outbid Andy if he bids conservatively while ensuring my payment is still less than my perceived value, maximizing my potential profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 37, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 37 and paid 23. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to maximize my profit while considering previous bidding patterns. Andy's bids have shown variations, but generally stayed below my current perceived value. In prior rounds, Andy bid 29, 25, 35, 1, and 12. To balance the need to win without overpaying, I'll place a bid that is roughly half my perceived value. This should give me a good chance of winning while ensuring a robust profit if I do.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 this round, my goal is to bid strategically to maximize profit while considering Andy's past bidding behavior. Andy's bids have fluctuated (29, 25, 35, 1, 12, 37), indicating both high and low bidding tendencies. To maximize profit without overpaying drastically, I opt to bid conservatively at 10. This should provide a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a favorable profit margin if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 1. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 9, and reviewing past rounds where Andy has placed both high and low bids, I will bid conservatively. By bidding 5, I minimize potential loss while still having a chance to win if Andy bids very low. This approach balances risk and potential profit by maintaining a cautious stance based on previous patterns.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 23 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by strategically bidding. Andy's previous bids have varied significantly but have often been above the perceived values I have experienced. However, Andy's lowest winning bid so far was 1. By bidding 12, I balance the chance of winning without overpaying, considering Andy's occasional low bids and my perceived value. This approach ensures a reasonable chance to win while maintaining a good profit margin if successful.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37 this round, I aim to balance out the likelihood of winning and maintaining maximum profit. Andy's bids have ranged from very low bids (1) to high bids (37). Given this information, a bid of 19 is half of my perceived value and is strategically placed to potentially outbid Andy on his lower bids while not overpaying if his bids trend higher. This approach aims to achieve a good balance between winning the bid and preserving a high profit margin if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66 this round, I aim to maximize my profit by considering the history of previous rounds. Noting that Andy's bids have ranged from 1 to 37, setting my bid at half of my perceived value, 33, strikes a balance between sufficiently outbidding Andy on lower bids while maintaining a high profit margin if I win. This approach also mitigates the risk of overpaying in cases where Andy bids high.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 11. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22 this round, and considering Andy's bid pattern in previous rounds where bids have ranged from 1 to 37, I will bid half of my perceived value (11). This strategy balances the chance of winning while ensuring I don't overpay, taking into account that values are redrawn independently each round. This approach should maximize my profit by maintaining a good potential return if I win without excessively high exposure to loss if Andy bids low.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 30.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my history and Bidder Andy's bidding patterns, placing my bid at half of my perceived value (which is 65) has been a balanced strategy. It should give me a good chance of winning while maximizing my profit potential. Andy's bids have varied widely, but aiming around the midpoint has previously proven effective, especially with my higher perceived values.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 29. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 58, and reviewing Andy's previous bids (ranging from 1 to 41), I aim to maximize my profit by strategically placing my bid around half of my perceived value. This has typically been an effective strategy in the past rounds. This approach balances the likelihood of winning and maintaining maximum profit by not overpaying, considering Andy's variable bid patterns. Thus, I decide to bid 29.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 86 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

By bidding 60, I balance the likelihood of winning against the risk of overpaying, thus maximizing potential profit if Andy continues to bid conservatively.

My current value for the prize is 28, which is considerably lower than previous rounds. To maximize profit while minimizing loss, I need to keep my bid low.

My value of 29 is quite low, so offering a bid of 20 allows me to potentially win without risking too much, aligning with my strategy from round 2 where a similar approach was taken.'

My value for this round is 35, and to ensure the optimal balance between winning the bid and securing a profit, I'll bid slightly lower than my full perceived value.

My value for this round is 49, so to balance the chance of winning and maximizing my profit, I'll bid moderately higher than my previous conservative bids. A bid of 35 stands a good chance of winning without reducing my profit margin significantly if Andy continues his high bidding pattern.'

A bid of 55 gives me a fair chance to outbid Andy without going too high, allowing for a reasonable profit margin based on past bid patterns where Andy's bids have been relatively high compared to perceived values.'

Historically, Andy has bid aggressively, but there have been instances where he bid slightly lower. By bidding 65, I am likely to outbid him while securing a high enough margin of profit even if he follows his aggressive bidding pattern. This bid balances the likelihood of winning with the necessity of maintaining a good profit.'

The winner's profit was 23.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that the values and bids are redrawn independently each round, I need to balance the potential profit against the risk of overpaying. My value for this round is 68. A bid of 45 gives me a good chance of winning without paying too close to my full value, ensuring a reasonable profit even against various strategies from the other bidder.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that in the previous round Bidder Andy placed a bid of 45 while having a perceived value of 68, it suggests a tendency for Andy to bid significantly lower than their perceived value. By bidding 60, I balance the likelihood of winning against the risk of overpaying, thus maximizing potential profit if Andy continues to bid conservatively. My perceived value is relatively high at 74, so a bid of 60 allows a safer margin for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy previously bid 75 when their value was likely close to 68, and bid 60 the same as my bid when the common value was 58, Andy appears to bid relatively high compared to what might be expected. My current value for the prize is 28, which is considerably lower than previous rounds. To maximize profit while minimizing loss, I need to keep my bid low. By bidding 20, I retain a chance of winning against a conservative Andy while not overpaying should I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that Andy seems to have a pattern of bidding aggressively, as evidenced by high bids relative to perceived values in previous rounds, and that he may continue this pattern, I aim to maximize my profit without overpaying. My value of 29 is quite low, so offering a bid of 20 allows me to potentially win without risking too much, aligning with my strategy from round 2 where a similar approach was taken.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of relatively high bids. My value for this round is 35, and to ensure the optimal balance between winning the bid and securing a profit, I'll bid slightly lower than my full perceived value. A bid of 28 provides a good chance of winning against an aggressive bidder like Andy while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin, considering the possibility of Andy bidding high again.'

The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 19, I want to minimize my risk of losing money while still leaving a chance for potential profit. Based on the history, Andy has a tendency to bid aggressively with relatively high bids. By bidding 10, I aim to maintain a conservative approach, limiting potential loss if Andy bids higher and respects the pattern observed.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical trend, Andy tends to bid aggressively. My value for this round is 49, so to balance the chance of winning and maximizing my profit, I'll bid moderately higher than my previous conservative bids. A bid of 35 stands a good chance of winning without reducing my profit margin significantly if Andy continues his high bidding pattern.'

The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 69 and the history of Andy's relatively aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to balance the need to win the prize while not overpaying. A bid of 55 gives me a fair chance to outbid Andy without going too high, allowing for a reasonable profit margin based on past bid patterns where Andy's bids have been relatively high compared to perceived values.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for this round is very high at 79, I want to increase my chances of winning while ensuring I retain a significant profit margin. Historically, Andy has bid aggressively, but there have been instances where he bid slightly lower. By bidding 65, I am likely to outbid him while securing a high enough margin of profit even if he follows his aggressive bidding pattern. This bid balances the likelihood of winning with the necessity of maintaining a good profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is quite low at 15 and considering Andy's historical tendency to bid relatively high, it is prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying or making a loss. A bid of 5 allows me to keep the risk low and provides a slight chance of winning if Andy makes an unexpectedly low bid, while minimizing potential loss if Andy continues his aggressive bidding pattern.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 23.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that the values and bids are redrawn independently each round, I need to balance the potential profit against the risk of overpaying. My value for this round is 68. A bid of 45 gives me a good chance of winning without paying too close to my full value, ensuring a reasonable profit even against various strategies from the other bidder.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that in the previous round Bidder Andy placed a bid of 45 while having a perceived value of 68, it suggests a tendency for Andy to bid significantly lower than their perceived value. By bidding 60, I balance the likelihood of winning against the risk of overpaying, thus maximizing potential profit if Andy continues to bid conservatively. My perceived value is relatively high at 74, so a bid of 60 allows a safer margin for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy previously bid 75 when their value was likely close to 68, and bid 60 the same as my bid when the common value was 58, Andy appears to bid relatively high compared to what might be expected. My current value for the prize is 28, which is considerably lower than previous rounds. To maximize profit while minimizing loss, I need to keep my bid low. By bidding 20, I retain a chance of winning against a conservative Andy while not overpaying should I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 15, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that Andy seems to have a pattern of bidding aggressively, as evidenced by high bids relative to perceived values in previous rounds, and that he may continue this pattern, I aim to maximize my profit without overpaying. My value of 29 is quite low, so offering a bid of 20 allows me to potentially win without risking too much, aligning with my strategy from round 2 where a similar approach was taken.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of relatively high bids. My value for this round is 35, and to ensure the optimal balance between winning the bid and securing a profit, I'll bid slightly lower than my full perceived value. A bid of 28 provides a good chance of winning against an aggressive bidder like Andy while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin, considering the possibility of Andy bidding high again.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 19, I want to minimize my risk of losing money while still leaving a chance for potential profit. Based on the history, Andy has a tendency to bid aggressively with relatively high bids. By bidding 10, I aim to maintain a conservative approach, limiting potential loss if Andy bids higher and respects the pattern observed.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical trend, Andy tends to bid aggressively. My value for this round is 49, so to balance the chance of winning and maximizing my profit, I'll bid moderately higher than my previous conservative bids. A bid of 35 stands a good chance of winning without reducing my profit margin significantly if Andy continues his high bidding pattern.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 69 and the history of Andy's relatively aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to balance the need to win the prize while not overpaying. A bid of 55 gives me a fair chance to outbid Andy without going too high, allowing for a reasonable profit margin based on past bid patterns where Andy's bids have been relatively high compared to perceived values.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for this round is very high at 79, I want to increase my chances of winning while ensuring I retain a significant profit margin. Historically, Andy has bid aggressively, but there have been instances where he bid slightly lower. By bidding 65, I am likely to outbid him while securing a high enough margin of profit even if he follows his aggressive bidding pattern. This bid balances the likelihood of winning with the necessity of maintaining a good profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is quite low at 15 and considering Andy's historical tendency to bid relatively high, it is prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying or making a loss. A bid of 5 allows me to keep the risk low and provides a slight chance of winning if Andy makes an unexpectedly low bid, while minimizing potential loss if Andy continues his aggressive bidding pattern.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical trend where Andy has bid relatively aggressively, I want to balance between winning the bid and ensuring a good profit. My value for this round is 46. A bid of 35 stands a reasonable chance of winning while maintaining a good profit margin, as it is lower than my full perceived value. This strategy leverages the likelihood that Andy continues with high bids.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45.

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy has shown a pattern of relatively aggressive bidding, I will aim to balance winning the prize and securing a good profit. My value for this round is 61.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy previously bid 75 when their value was likely close to 68, and bid 60 the same as my bid when the common value was 58, Andy appears to bid relatively high compared to what might be expected. My current value for the prize is 28, which is considerably lower than previous rounds. To maximize profit while minimizing loss, I need to keep my bid low. By bidding 20, I retain a chance of winning against a conservative Andy while not overpaying should I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 15, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that Andy seems to have a pattern of bidding aggressively, as evidenced by high bids relative to perceived values in previous rounds, and that he may continue this pattern, I aim to maximize my profit without overpaying. My value of 29 is quite low, so offering a bid of 20 allows me to potentially win without risking too much, aligning with my strategy from round 2 where a similar approach was taken.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of relatively high bids. My value for this round is 35, and to ensure the optimal balance between winning the bid and securing a profit, I'll bid slightly lower than my full perceived value. A bid of 28 provides a good chance of winning against an aggressive bidder like Andy while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin, considering the possibility of Andy bidding high again.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 19, I want to minimize my risk of losing money while still leaving a chance for potential profit. Based on the history, Andy has a tendency to bid aggressively with relatively high bids. By bidding 10, I aim to maintain a conservative approach, limiting potential loss if Andy bids higher and respects the pattern observed.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical trend, Andy tends to bid aggressively. My value for this round is 49, so to balance the chance of winning and maximizing my profit, I'll bid moderately higher than my previous conservative bids. A bid of 35 stands a good chance of winning without reducing my profit margin significantly if Andy continues his high bidding pattern.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 69 and the history of Andy's relatively aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to balance the need to win the prize while not overpaying. A bid of 55 gives me a fair chance to outbid Andy without going too high, allowing for a reasonable profit margin based on past bid patterns where Andy's bids have been relatively high compared to perceived values.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for this round is very high at 79, I want to increase my chances of winning while ensuring I retain a significant profit margin. Historically, Andy has bid aggressively, but there have been instances where he bid slightly lower. By bidding 65, I am likely to outbid him while securing a high enough margin of profit even if he follows his aggressive bidding pattern. This bid balances the likelihood of winning with the necessity of maintaining a good profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is quite low at 15 and considering Andy's historical tendency to bid relatively high, it is prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying or making a loss. A bid of 5 allows me to keep the risk low and provides a slight chance of winning if Andy makes an unexpectedly low bid, while minimizing potential loss if Andy continues his aggressive bidding pattern.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical trend where Andy has bid relatively aggressively, I want to balance between winning the bid and ensuring a good profit. My value for this round is 46. A bid of 35 stands a reasonable chance of winning while maintaining a good profit margin, as it is lower than my full perceived value. This strategy leverages the likelihood that Andy continues with high bids.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy has shown a pattern of relatively aggressive bidding, I will aim to balance winning the prize and securing a good profit. My value for this round is 61. Based on past rounds, by bidding 45, I have a reasonable chance of winning while leaving enough margin to ensure a profit even if Andy bids aggressively again.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10.

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 15, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that Andy seems to have a pattern of bidding aggressively, as evidenced by high bids relative to perceived values in previous rounds, and that he may continue this pattern, I aim to maximize my profit without overpaying. My value of 29 is quite low, so offering a bid of 20 allows me to potentially win without risking too much, aligning with my strategy from round 2 where a similar approach was taken.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of relatively high bids. My value for this round is 35, and to ensure the optimal balance between winning the bid and securing a profit, I'll bid slightly lower than my full perceived value. A bid of 28 provides a good chance of winning against an aggressive bidder like Andy while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin, considering the possibility of Andy bidding high again.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 19, I want to minimize my risk of losing money while still leaving a chance for potential profit. Based on the history, Andy has a tendency to bid aggressively with relatively high bids. By bidding 10, I aim to maintain a conservative approach, limiting potential loss if Andy bids higher and respects the pattern observed.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical trend, Andy tends to bid aggressively. My value for this round is 49, so to balance the chance of winning and maximizing my profit, I'll bid moderately higher than my previous conservative bids. A bid of 35 stands a good chance of winning without reducing my profit margin significantly if Andy continues his high bidding pattern.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 69 and the history of Andy's relatively aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to balance the need to win the prize while not overpaying. A bid of 55 gives me a fair chance to outbid Andy without going too high, allowing for a reasonable profit margin based on past bid patterns where Andy's bids have been relatively high compared to perceived values.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for this round is very high at 79, I want to increase my chances of winning while ensuring I retain a significant profit margin. Historically, Andy has bid aggressively, but there have been instances where he bid slightly lower. By bidding 65, I am likely to outbid him while securing a high enough margin of profit even if he follows his aggressive bidding pattern. This bid balances the likelihood of winning with the necessity of maintaining a good profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is quite low at 15 and considering Andy's historical tendency to bid relatively high, it is prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying or making a loss. A bid of 5 allows me to keep the risk low and provides a slight chance of winning if Andy makes an unexpectedly low bid, while minimizing potential loss if Andy continues his aggressive bidding pattern.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical trend where Andy has bid relatively aggressively, I want to balance between winning the bid and ensuring a good profit. My value for this round is 46. A bid of 35 stands a reasonable chance of winning while maintaining a good profit margin, as it is lower than my full perceived value. This strategy leverages the likelihood that Andy continues with high bids.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that Andy has shown a pattern of relatively aggressive bidding, I will aim to balance winning the prize and securing a good profit. My value for this round is 61. Based on past rounds, by bidding 45, I have a reasonable chance of winning while leaving enough margin to ensure a profit even if Andy bids aggressively again.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25 and considering Andy's historical tendency to bid relatively high, I want to minimize my risk of losing money while still leaving a chance for potential profit. Bidding 10 allows me to keep potential losses low if Andy bids aggressively and provides a small chance of winning if his bid is unexpectedly low.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value for the prize this round is 30 and Bidder Andy's historical pattern of bidding relatively aggressively, I want to balance the chance of winning with not overpaying. A bid of 20 should give me a potential to win the prize at a reasonable margin while minimizing risk, given that Andy's bids have often been higher. This allows me to possibly secure a profit without overbidding.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 53 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 35, I'm deciding to bid slightly over half of my perceived value (around 51.4%), considering the history where the highest bids in the previous round were 14 and 12. This approach balances potential profit while still being competitive enough to win if the other bidder has a similar assessment.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 22, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 22 and paid 19.

In prior rounds, the second-highest bids and the winning bids were also close to this percentage range. Therefore, by bidding 19, I balance the likelihood of winning the auction at a reasonable cost while maximizing potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 90 for the prize, I aim to bid around 50% of my perceived value. Analyzing previous rounds, my bids have been slightly over 50% of my value, providing a competitive edge while balancing potential profit. In round 2, a bid around half my value would have won. Therefore, I choose to bid 45 to maximize my chance of winning without overcommitting financially.'

In previous rounds, this approach has ensured that my bid is competitive, maximizing my likelihood of winning while controlling the cost if I win. Hence, I choose to bid 26 to balance the potential profit and the risk of overbidding.'

For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 38, similar to my previous strategies, I aim to bid around 50% of my perceived value. In prior rounds, the second-highest bids and the winning bids were also close to this percentage range. Therefore, by bidding 19, I balance the likelihood of winning the auction at a reasonable cost while maximizing potential profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, this approach has balanced my likelihood of winning and my potential profit effectively. Given the independent redraw of values each round, bidding 20 should keep my bid competitive without overcommitting financially.'

To maximize my profit, I want to place a bid that is competitive but also leaves room for significant profit if I win.

In Round 0, she bid 70 when the perceived value was high, and in Round 1, she bid 55 when the perceived value was medium. In Round 2, she bid 15 when the perceived value was low. Given my current value of 50, a bid of 45 positions me to potentially win if her perceived value and bid are moderately lower, maximizing my profit margin if the second-highest bid from Betty (projected to be around 40-50) determines my payment.'

In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 15.

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 and considering previous bidding history where the second-highest bid often falls slightly below the perceived value, bidding 32 allows me to be competitive. It also maximizes the chances of a positive profit margin if Betty bids lower, which is consistent with her bidding behavior when her perceived value is moderate to low.'

Given my current perceived value of 25, I want to place a bid that allows for a conservative approach to limit potential losses. By bidding 15, I balance the potential to win the prize at a low cost while avoiding the risk of overbidding similar to the earlier rounds, where I encountered losses due to high bids.'

This bid should be high enough to give me a chance to win the auction but not too high to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Thus, I am choosing to bid 23, balancing the risk and potential reward.'

By bidding 25, I aim to balance the possibility of winning the auction without overbidding, as in previous rounds Andy has shown a tendency to bid high, which increases the risk of overpayment on my part.'

Given that we have observed Andy often bids significantly higher, a conservative bid of 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding significant loss, should the common value and Andy's bid deviate from my perceived value.'

Based on previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of aggressive bidding.

This bid is designed to be high enough to potentially outbid Andy while still leaving significant room for profit, considering that the final payment is equal to the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've observed Andy's aggressive bidding behavior. Given my current perceived value of 25, I want to place a bid that allows for a conservative approach to limit potential losses. By bidding 15, I balance the potential to win the prize at a low cost while avoiding the risk of overbidding similar to the earlier rounds, where I encountered losses due to high bids.'

The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 and observing the bidding history where Andy tends to bid aggressively above the perceived values, I aim to place a bid that is competitive yet conservative. This bid should be high enough to give me a chance to win the auction but not too high to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Thus, I am choosing to bid 23, balancing the risk and potential reward.'

This bid of 18 allows me to stay in the game without risking overpayment, given that the bids in previous rounds suggest Andy often bids significantly higher than I do.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 22.

By bidding 25, I aim to balance the possibility of winning the auction without overbidding, as in previous rounds Andy has shown a tendency to bid high, which increases the risk of overpayment on my part.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 40 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. By bidding 22, it provides a balanced approach to potentially win the auction without risking significant loss, as overbidding can reduce my profit margin significantly.'

Andy tends to bid high, often significantly above the perceived value, so with a bid of 12, I aim to balance the chance of winning while minimizing potential overpayment.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 23 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, my strategy should be to place a bid that allows for potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Given that we have observed Andy often bids significantly higher, a conservative bid of 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding significant loss, should the common value and Andy's bid deviate from my perceived value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 16.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'For this round, my perceived value for the prize is 66. Based on previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of aggressive bidding. Given this, I need to place a bid that is competitive enough to potentially win but low enough to maximize profit if I do win. A bid of 45 balances these considerations by being reasonably aggressive without overpaying too much relative to the perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 28.

Previous rounds show Betty's bids can range widely depending on her perceived value, often ending up below mid-value levels when my perceived value was relatively low.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the current value of 96 and the need to maximize profit, I will bid 70. This bid is designed to be high enough to potentially outbid Andy while still leaving significant room for profit, considering that the final payment is equal to the second-highest bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history, in the previous round, Andy bid 75 when the common value was 77, suggesting an aggressive bidding style. My perceived value is 58. By bidding 55, I aim to balance a competitive bid with the potential for profit, anticipating Andy might bid above or near my value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've observed Andy's aggressive bidding behavior. Given my current perceived value of 25, I want to place a bid that allows for a conservative approach to limit potential losses. By bidding 15, I balance the potential to win the prize at a low cost while avoiding the risk of overbidding similar to the earlier rounds, where I encountered losses due to high bids.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 23. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 and observing the bidding history where Andy tends to bid aggressively above the perceived values, I aim to place a bid that is competitive yet conservative. This bid should be high enough to give me a chance to win the auction but not too high to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Thus, I am choosing to bid 23, balancing the risk and potential reward.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the perceived value of 47 and based on the past rounds, Andy tends to bid aggressively. To maximize potential profit, I need to place a bid that is moderately competitive but conservative enough to prevent me from overpaying. By bidding 33, I aim to balance my chances of winning against reducing potential losses, should the common value or Andy's bid be closer to the lower end.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 26 and noting Andy's pattern of aggressive bids (high bids and overbidding close to the perceived values), my strategy is to place a bid that is conservatively competitive. This bid of 18 allows me to stay in the game without risking overpayment, given that the bids in previous rounds suggest Andy often bids significantly higher than I do.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 35 and Andy's consistent pattern of aggressive bids, my strategy should be to place a bid that allows for a potential win while minimizing potential loss. By bidding 25, I aim to balance the possibility of winning the auction without overbidding, as in previous rounds Andy has shown a tendency to bid high, which increases the risk of overpayment on my part.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 40 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. By bidding 22, it provides a balanced approach to potentially win the auction without risking significant loss, as overbidding can reduce my profit margin significantly.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 16 and Andy's consistent pattern of aggressive bidding, it would be prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Andy tends to bid high, often significantly above the perceived value, so with a bid of 12, I aim to balance the chance of winning while minimizing potential overpayment.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 23 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, my strategy should be to place a bid that allows for potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Given that we have observed Andy often bids significantly higher, a conservative bid of 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding significant loss, should the common value and Andy's bid deviate from my perceived value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 16.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'For this round, my perceived value for the prize is 66. Based on previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of aggressive bidding. Given this, I need to place a bid that is competitive enough to potentially win but low enough to maximize profit if I do win. A bid of 45 balances these considerations by being reasonably aggressive without overpaying too much relative to the perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 28.

Based on past rounds, Andy tends to bid significantly higher than the perceived value, thus a bid of 28 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding considerable loss, should the common value or Andy's bid deviate from my own perceived value.'

Based on past rounds, Andy's bids have often been significantly higher than mine. By bidding 55, I am keeping my bid competitive yet conservative enough to maintain a healthy profit margin if I win.

Previous rounds show Betty's bids can range widely depending on her perceived value, often ending up below mid-value levels when my perceived value was relatively low. Bidding 5 places me competitively but conservatively, ensuring that if I win, I will likely achieve a small but positive profit, or at minimal loss if I don't win.'

All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 23', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 96, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the current value of 96 and the need to maximize profit, I will bid 70. This bid is designed to be high enough to potentially outbid Andy while still leaving significant room for profit, considering that the final payment is equal to the second-highest bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history, in the previous round, Andy bid 75 when the common value was 77, suggesting an aggressive bidding style. My perceived value is 58. By bidding 55, I aim to balance a competitive bid with the potential for profit, anticipating Andy might bid above or near my value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've observed Andy's aggressive bidding behavior. Given my current perceived value of 25, I want to place a bid that allows for a conservative approach to limit potential losses. By bidding 15, I balance the potential to win the prize at a low cost while avoiding the risk of overbidding similar to the earlier rounds, where I encountered losses due to high bids.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 23. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 and observing the bidding history where Andy tends to bid aggressively above the perceived values, I aim to place a bid that is competitive yet conservative. This bid should be high enough to give me a chance to win the auction but not too high to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Thus, I am choosing to bid 23, balancing the risk and potential reward.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the perceived value of 47 and based on the past rounds, Andy tends to bid aggressively. To maximize potential profit, I need to place a bid that is moderately competitive but conservative enough to prevent me from overpaying. By bidding 33, I aim to balance my chances of winning against reducing potential losses, should the common value or Andy's bid be closer to the lower end.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 6, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 26 and noting Andy's pattern of aggressive bids (high bids and overbidding close to the perceived values), my strategy is to place a bid that is conservatively competitive. This bid of 18 allows me to stay in the game without risking overpayment, given that the bids in previous rounds suggest Andy often bids significantly higher than I do.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 35 and Andy's consistent pattern of aggressive bids, my strategy should be to place a bid that allows for a potential win while minimizing potential loss. By bidding 25, I aim to balance the possibility of winning the auction without overbidding, as in previous rounds Andy has shown a tendency to bid high, which increases the risk of overpayment on my part.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 40 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. By bidding 22, it provides a balanced approach to potentially win the auction without risking significant loss, as overbidding can reduce my profit margin significantly.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 16 and Andy's consistent pattern of aggressive bidding, it would be prudent to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding and potential losses. Andy tends to bid high, often significantly above the perceived value, so with a bid of 12, I aim to balance the chance of winning while minimizing potential overpayment.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 23 and Andy's historical aggressive bidding pattern, my strategy should be to place a bid that allows for potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Given that we have observed Andy often bids significantly higher, a conservative bid of 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding significant loss, should the common value and Andy's bid deviate from my perceived value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 16.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'For this round, my perceived value for the prize is 66. Based on previous rounds, Andy has shown a pattern of aggressive bidding. Given this, I need to place a bid that is competitive enough to potentially win but low enough to maximize profit if I do win. A bid of 45 balances these considerations by being reasonably aggressive without overpaying too much relative to the perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for this round is 41 and observing Andy's historical aggressive bidding patterns, it would be prudent to place a bid that allows for potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Based on past rounds, Andy tends to bid significantly higher than the perceived value, thus a bid of 28 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding considerable loss, should the common value or Andy's bid deviate from my own perceived value.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 and considering Andy's historical aggressive bidding behavior, I will place a relatively high bid to maximize my chances of winning. Based on past rounds, Andy's bids have often been significantly higher than mine. By bidding 55, I am keeping my bid competitive yet conservative enough to maintain a healthy profit margin if I win. This bid attempts to strike a balance between winning the auction and managing potential overbidding risks.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 14, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 22 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 32 for this round and considering Andy's historical aggressive bidding behavior, I aim to place a bid that balances competitiveness with the potential for profit. A bid of 20 should be low enough to avoid significant losses if Andy bids very high again, but high enough to have a chance of winning if Andy bids closer to the common value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 23 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.
