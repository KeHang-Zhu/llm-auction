The common value as such might be averaging around mid-20s to 30s based on bid behavior.

From previous rounds, other bids have been notably higher than the true common value.

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 23, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 23 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25, I need to bid in a way that balances my chances of winning with a positive profit. From the previous round, the bids were 25, 24, and 20. I assume the common value was approximately equal to one of the private adjustments. Bidding around 18 should be low enough to possibly not overpay while giving me a chance to win if the others bid cautiously. This helps in maximizing profit by not risking too much on a bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 76, and based on the history of previous rounds where winning bids were 25 and 23 respectively, I need to ensure my bid is competitive but not too high. The common value as such might be averaging around mid-20s to 30s based on bid behavior. By bidding 40, I aim to secure the prize with a good chance of avoiding excessive payment (second-highest bid is likely still in the 20s), ultimately maximizing my profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 10, I need to be cautious with my bid to avoid overpaying and ensure any potential profit. From previous rounds, other bids have been notably higher than the true common value. By bidding 5, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing risk, considering that I have a low perceived value this time. This strategy helps in maximizing total profit over the game.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 74 and based on previous bid patterns (where the highest bids were 25, 23, 79, and 20), I aim to submit a competitive bid without exceeding the value too much. A bid of 55 balances my chances of winning the prize while maximizing profit by avoiding too high a second-highest bid from other participants.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my perceived value is 87, which is significantly higher than in previous rounds. Based on the bidding history, previous winning bids have ranged from as low as 5 to as high as 79. To maximize my profit and still have a good chance of winning, I will bid 60. This bid is strategically high enough to likely outbid others but also leaves a sufficient margin below my total value to ensure a positive profit if I win and the second-highest bid is reasonable.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45.

In previous rounds, winning bids have varied but often the second-highest bids were notably lower. A bid of around 45 should be competitive enough to secure the prize without risking too much on the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 60 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The common value as such might be averaging around mid-20s to 30s based on bid behavior.

Based on the bidding history, previous winning bids have ranged from as low as 5 to as high as 79. To maximize my profit and still have a good chance of winning, I will bid 60. This bid is strategically high enough to likely outbid others but also leaves a sufficient margin below my total value to ensure a positive profit if I win and the second-highest bid is reasonable.'

From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize.

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly less than my perceived value while still being within a competitive range can help maximize profit. In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable. Therefore, bidding 20 with a value of 26 balances the risk and maximizes the chance of winning with a profit margin.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 28. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, where aggressive bidding sometimes led to high profits (as seen in Round 2 with a bid of 79), and conservative bidding didn't always ensure wins (as seen in Rounds 0 and 1), I\u2019ll balance between them. Given my value of 67, I'll bid 58. This is competitive enough to likely win, considering earlier rounds' bids, while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 85, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 40. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 90, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize. For instance, in round 2, a high bid of 79 with a value of 81 secured a win with a substantial profit due to the significantly lower second-highest bid. Therefore, bidding 85 should secure the win while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower, as observed in previous bids such as 40, 20, or 58.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I need to bid close to my perceived value to ensure a high chance of winning. In previous rounds, I've observed that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value secures the prize and often results in a significantly lower second-highest bid. For instance, in round 5, a bid of 85 with a value of 90 secured a win with a positive profit. To maximize profit while ensuring a win, I will bid 80, which is slightly lower than my perceived value but competitive enough based on previous bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I want to apply a strategy that balances competitiveness with profitability. Reviewing previous rounds, we observe that aggressively high bids secure wins but can risk lower profits. Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 51 in this round, I need to consider past rounds' bidding behavior to maximize profit. In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 70 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 23, 20, 18.

Bidding 20 moves to ensure I have a chance to win without risking a bid too high, which could result in a negative profit. Given the history, a bid of 20 stands a reasonable chance of winning and maximizes the potential for a positive profit margin since it is close to the lower end of the bidding spectrum observed.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 34.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 81, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. Based on the previous rounds, we saw bids ranging from 18 to 25, which shows some competitiveness but not extreme. Therefore, bidding 79 would likely secure the win while ensuring my profit is maximized by keeping the second-highest bid (which I expect to be around 20-25) lower, thus resulting in substantial profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly less than my perceived value while still being within a competitive range can help maximize profit. In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable. Therefore, bidding 20 with a value of 26 balances the risk and maximizes the chance of winning with a profit margin.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 28. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51.

Given my value of 67, I'll bid 58. This is competitive enough to likely win, considering earlier rounds' bids, while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 85, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 40. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60.

The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 90, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize. For instance, in round 2, a high bid of 79 with a value of 81 secured a win with a substantial profit due to the significantly lower second-highest bid. Therefore, bidding 85 should secure the win while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower, as observed in previous bids such as 40, 20, or 58.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45.

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I need to bid close to my perceived value to ensure a high chance of winning. In previous rounds, I've observed that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value secures the prize and often results in a significantly lower second-highest bid. For instance, in round 5, a bid of 85 with a value of 90 secured a win with a positive profit. To maximize profit while ensuring a win, I will bid 80, which is slightly lower than my perceived value but competitive enough based on previous bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I want to apply a strategy that balances competitiveness with profitability. Reviewing previous rounds, we observe that aggressively high bids secure wins but can risk lower profits. Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 51 in this round, I need to consider past rounds' bidding behavior to maximize profit. In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 62, 62.

Previous rounds indicate aggressive but slightly conservative bids often secure the prize with a good margin. For example, in round 4, a bid close to the perceived value (58 with a value of 67) secured the win profitably.

This bid considers other bidders' behavior and aims to maximize profit by setting a strategic and moderate bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 78, and considering the previous rounds where the highest bids were 25 and 23, I want to bid just slightly higher than the highest bid from previous rounds to increase my chances of winning while maintaining a competitive margin. A bid of 26 seems like a balanced choice to maximize my profit without overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22, I will bid slightly below it to maximize profit while remaining competitive. Based on previous rounds where bids ranged from 18 to 79, a bid of 19 seems likely to win if the others bid conservatively, especially given recent losing bids were 24 and below.'

Considering the bids have been anywhere from 5 to 79, my objective is to bid high enough to win the prize without overpaying based on previous bidding patterns. A bid of 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and strategic conservatism.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the given history, it is evident that winning bids have generally ranged between 20 and 85, but competitors are willing to bid high in the case of high perceived values. A value of 81 suggests that the prize is significant to me. To maximize my profit yet stay competitive without overbidding excessively, a bid of 65 seems strategic. This considers both competitiveness and conservatism, aiming to be higher than the second-highest bid typically seen in higher-value rounds.'

Considering bids have ranged widely from 5 to 85, and aiming for a strategic balance, I would bid 55, which is competitive yet not excessively high compared to the perceived value of 68.'

To stay competitive while aiming to maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 45 seems strategic. This approach considers the bidding patterns of previous rounds, where the second-highest bids are often close but not excessively high.'

Historical winning bids have ranged from relatively low to high amounts, and second-highest bids have occasionally been significant. By bidding 62, I aim to increase my chances of winning the prize while ensuring the bids remain profitable relative to the value of 74, considering the second-highest bid likely to be just below this value.'

Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.'

Bidding 20 moves to ensure I have a chance to win without risking a bid too high, which could result in a negative profit. Given the history, a bid of 20 stands a reasonable chance of winning and maximizes the potential for a positive profit margin since it is close to the lower end of the bidding spectrum observed.'

In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable. Therefore, bidding 20 with a value of 26 balances the risk and maximizes the chance of winning with a profit margin.'

Given my value of 67, I'll bid 58. This is competitive enough to likely win, considering earlier rounds' bids, while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize. For instance, in round 2, a high bid of 79 with a value of 81 secured a win with a substantial profit due to the significantly lower second-highest bid. Therefore, bidding 85 should secure the win while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower, as observed in previous bids such as 40, 20, or 58.'

In previous rounds, I've observed that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value secures the prize and often results in a significantly lower second-highest bid. For instance, in round 5, a bid of 85 with a value of 90 secured a win with a positive profit. To maximize profit while ensuring a win, I will bid 80, which is slightly lower than my perceived value but competitive enough based on previous bids.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I want to apply a strategy that balances competitiveness with profitability. Reviewing previous rounds, we observe that aggressively high bids secure wins but can risk lower profits. Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 51 in this round, I need to consider past rounds' bidding behavior to maximize profit. In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.'

Previous rounds indicate aggressive but slightly conservative bids often secure the prize with a good margin. For example, in round 4, a bid close to the perceived value (58 with a value of 67) secured the win profitably. Therefore, I choose to bid 62, which is competitive enough within my perceived value range, yet still aims to leave a profit based on the expected behavior of other bidders.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32.

Bidding too close to my maximum value might result in a negative profit if I win. Based on my experience and history of previous rounds, bidding 20 should give me a competitive chance to win without risking too much.'

From the previous round, the bids were 25, 24, and 20. I assume the common value was approximately equal to one of the private adjustments. Bidding around 18 should be low enough to possibly not overpay while giving me a chance to win if the others bid cautiously. This helps in maximizing profit by not risking too much on a bid.'

The common value as such might be averaging around mid-20s to 30s based on bid behavior. By bidding 40, I aim to secure the prize with a good chance of avoiding excessive payment (second-highest bid is likely still in the 20s), ultimately maximizing my profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 10, I need to be cautious with my bid to avoid overpaying and ensure any potential profit. From previous rounds, other bids have been notably higher than the true common value. By bidding 5, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing risk, considering that I have a low perceived value this time. This strategy helps in maximizing total profit over the game.'

Based on the bidding history, previous winning bids have ranged from as low as 5 to as high as 79. To maximize my profit and still have a good chance of winning, I will bid 60. This bid is strategically high enough to likely outbid others but also leaves a sufficient margin below my total value to ensure a positive profit if I win and the second-highest bid is reasonable.'

In previous rounds, winning bids have varied but often the second-highest bids were notably lower. A bid of around 45 should be competitive enough to secure the prize without risking too much on the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my profit.'

A bid of 50 is strategic as it is high enough to increase my chances of winning, yet leaves a margin to ensure a positive profit if the second-highest bid is reasonably lower than my bid.'

Based on past rounds, bidding around 45 to 50 has been competitive without overpaying.

From previous rounds, I noticed that bids close to the perceived value (but not exceeding it) often secure the win while leaving a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid aligns reasonably. By bidding 65, I aim to be competitive against Betty and Charles, who have shown tendencies to bid high, while still ensuring a positive profit if the second-highest bid is lower by a decent margin.'

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 34.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 81, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. Based on the previous rounds, we saw bids ranging from 18 to 25, which shows some competitiveness but not extreme. Therefore, bidding 79 would likely secure the win while ensuring my profit is maximized by keeping the second-highest bid (which I expect to be around 20-25) lower, thus resulting in substantial profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly less than my perceived value while still being within a competitive range can help maximize profit. In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable. Therefore, bidding 20 with a value of 26 balances the risk and maximizes the chance of winning with a profit margin.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 28. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, where aggressive bidding sometimes led to high profits (as seen in Round 2 with a bid of 79), and conservative bidding didn't always ensure wins (as seen in Rounds 0 and 1), I\u2019ll balance between them. Given my value of 67, I'll bid 58. This is competitive enough to likely win, considering earlier rounds' bids, while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 85, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 40. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 90, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize. For instance, in round 2, a high bid of 79 with a value of 81 secured a win with a substantial profit due to the significantly lower second-highest bid. Therefore, bidding 85 should secure the win while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower, as observed in previous bids such as 40, 20, or 58.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I need to bid close to my perceived value to ensure a high chance of winning. In previous rounds, I've observed that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value secures the prize and often results in a significantly lower second-highest bid. For instance, in round 5, a bid of 85 with a value of 90 secured a win with a positive profit. To maximize profit while ensuring a win, I will bid 80, which is slightly lower than my perceived value but competitive enough based on previous bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I want to apply a strategy that balances competitiveness with profitability. Reviewing previous rounds, we observe that aggressively high bids secure wins but can risk lower profits. Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 51 in this round, I need to consider past rounds' bidding behavior to maximize profit. In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 62, 62. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 70, I aim to maximize my profit while ensuring a strong chance of winning. Previous rounds indicate aggressive but slightly conservative bids often secure the prize with a good margin. For example, in round 4, a bid close to the perceived value (58 with a value of 67) secured the win profitably. Therefore, I choose to bid 62, which is competitive enough within my perceived value range, yet still aims to leave a profit based on the expected behavior of other bidders.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize this round, I strategically aim to balance competitiveness with profitability. Reflecting on previous rounds, conservative bids slightly below the perceived value have shown reasonable chances of winning while ensuring the possibility of positive profits. For instance, in round 9, a bid close to but not exceeding the perceived value helped secure good profit margins. Therefore, bidding 36 provides competitiveness without severely risking overpayment, increasing the likelihood of securing the prize profitably.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 88, previous rounds have shown that aggressive bidding close to my perceived value often secures the prize but sometimes results in minimal or negative profits due to the high second-highest bids. For example, in rounds where I bid closer to my value, like 85 out of 90, I had positive if not optimal profits. Balancing competitiveness with profitability, I should bid 74, which is competitive yet conservative enough to likely secure a win and avoid too high a payment, maximizing the chances for a positive profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 45 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 26, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 78, and considering the previous rounds where the highest bids were 25 and 23, I want to bid just slightly higher than the highest bid from previous rounds to increase my chances of winning while maintaining a competitive margin. A bid of 26 seems like a balanced choice to maximize my profit without overbidding.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22, I will bid slightly below it to maximize profit while remaining competitive. Based on previous rounds where bids ranged from 18 to 79, a bid of 19 seems likely to win if the others bid conservatively, especially given recent losing bids were 24 and below.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 76 and analyzing previous rounds where bids ranged from 5 to 79, I observe that the second-highest bid tends to be around half of the highest bid or a bit more. By bidding 51, I aim to be competitive and win the auction while likely paying a second-highest bid that's relatively lower, ensuring a significant profit margin.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 92 and analyzing previous rounds where bids have ranged widely, I observe that to maximize my total profit, my bid should be competitive yet not excessively high. Considering the bids have been anywhere from 5 to 79, my objective is to bid high enough to win the prize without overpaying based on previous bidding patterns. A bid of 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and strategic conservatism.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the given history, it is evident that winning bids have generally ranged between 20 and 85, but competitors are willing to bid high in the case of high perceived values. A value of 81 suggests that the prize is significant to me. To maximize my profit yet stay competitive without overbidding excessively, a bid of 65 seems strategic. This considers both competitiveness and conservatism, aiming to be higher than the second-highest bid typically seen in higher-value rounds.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the analysis of previous rounds, the winning bid tends to be higher than the average but not always the highest possible bid. Considering bids have ranged widely from 5 to 85, and aiming for a strategic balance, I would bid 55, which is competitive yet not excessively high compared to the perceived value of 68.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 49, analyzing previous rounds shows that bidding just below my perceived value has been somewhat effective. To stay competitive while aiming to maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 45 seems strategic. This approach considers the bidding patterns of previous rounds, where the second-highest bids are often close but not excessively high.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 62, 62. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 74, I need to bid competitively while ensuring I don't overpay excessively. Historical winning bids have ranged from relatively low to high amounts, and second-highest bids have occasionally been significant. By bidding 62, I aim to increase my chances of winning the prize while ensuring the bids remain profitable relative to the value of 74, considering the second-highest bid likely to be just below this value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 34 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that strategically bidding just below my perceived value tends to be effective. The highest bids have ranged from very low to very high, but staying close to my perceived value gives me a competitive edge. Bidding 32 allows me to stay competitive while maximizing my chances of winning without overpaying.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68 and analyzing the bids in previous rounds, a bid just below my perceived value but still competitive would be strategic. In the past, bids around 60 have shown to be strong and competitive without being excessively high, considering the range of bids from 5 to 85. A bid of 60 aims to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overpay significantly.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 33.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 38, I want to stay competitive without bidding too close to my perceived value and risking overpayment. Analyzing previous rounds, second-highest bids often hover slightly below the highest bids.

Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.'

Bidding 20 moves to ensure I have a chance to win without risking a bid too high, which could result in a negative profit. Given the history, a bid of 20 stands a reasonable chance of winning and maximizes the potential for a positive profit margin since it is close to the lower end of the bidding spectrum observed.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly less than my perceived value while still being within a competitive range can help maximize profit. In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable.

From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize.

Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.'

In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.'

Previous rounds indicate aggressive but slightly conservative bids often secure the prize with a good margin. For example, in round 4, a bid close to the perceived value (58 with a value of 67) secured the win profitably. Therefore, I choose to bid 62, which is competitive enough within my perceived value range, yet still aims to leave a profit based on the expected behavior of other bidders.'

For example, in rounds where I bid closer to my value, like 85 out of 90, I had positive if not optimal profits. Balancing competitiveness with profitability, I should bid 74, which is competitive yet conservative enough to likely secure a win and avoid too high a payment, maximizing the chances for a positive profit.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 23, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 23 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25, I need to bid in a way that balances my chances of winning with a positive profit. From the previous round, the bids were 25, 24, and 20. I assume the common value was approximately equal to one of the private adjustments. Bidding around 18 should be low enough to possibly not overpay while giving me a chance to win if the others bid cautiously. This helps in maximizing profit by not risking too much on a bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 76, and based on the history of previous rounds where winning bids were 25 and 23 respectively, I need to ensure my bid is competitive but not too high. The common value as such might be averaging around mid-20s to 30s based on bid behavior. By bidding 40, I aim to secure the prize with a good chance of avoiding excessive payment (second-highest bid is likely still in the 20s), ultimately maximizing my profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 10, I need to be cautious with my bid to avoid overpaying and ensure any potential profit. From previous rounds, other bids have been notably higher than the true common value. By bidding 5, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing risk, considering that I have a low perceived value this time. This strategy helps in maximizing total profit over the game.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 74 and based on previous bid patterns (where the highest bids were 25, 23, 79, and 20), I aim to submit a competitive bid without exceeding the value too much. A bid of 55 balances my chances of winning the prize while maximizing profit by avoiding too high a second-highest bid from other participants.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my perceived value is 87, which is significantly higher than in previous rounds. Based on the bidding history, previous winning bids have ranged from as low as 5 to as high as 79. To maximize my profit and still have a good chance of winning, I will bid 60. This bid is strategically high enough to likely outbid others but also leaves a sufficient margin below my total value to ensure a positive profit if I win and the second-highest bid is reasonable.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 69, I need to balance the chance of winning with ensuring a positive profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have varied but often the second-highest bids were notably lower. A bid of around 45 should be competitive enough to secure the prize without risking too much on the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and considering the history of previous rounds, where bids have varied significantly but second-highest bids were often reasonably lower than the top bid, I want to balance a competitive bid with the potential for maximizing profit. A bid of 50 is strategic as it is high enough to increase my chances of winning, yet leaves a margin to ensure a positive profit if the second-highest bid is reasonably lower than my bid.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 55, I want to bid strategically to ensure I have a good chance of winning while maximizing profit. Based on past rounds, bidding around 45 to 50 has been competitive without overpaying. A bid of 47 should balance the chance of winning with minimizing the payment, assuming other bidders follow similar patterns from previous rounds.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 62, 62. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 71, I want to submit a bid that is competitive enough to win while maximizing my profit. From previous rounds, I noticed that bids close to the perceived value (but not exceeding it) often secure the win while leaving a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid aligns reasonably. By bidding 65, I aim to be competitive against Betty and Charles, who have shown tendencies to bid high, while still ensuring a positive profit if the second-highest bid is lower by a decent margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 50 and analyzing the previous rounds, I've noticed that placing slightly lower but competitive bids often helps balance winning chances while minimizing the payment if I win. High bids have sometimes resulted in negative profits due to the second-highest bid being significantly lower. By bidding 45, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive and ensuring a positive profit if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 69 and considering the history of previous rounds where bidding close to my perceived value has yielded the best outcomes, particularly the recent round where I won by bidding 65 with a value of 71, I will bid 65. This bid should be competitive enough to win while maximizing my profit by keeping the second-highest bid reasonably low.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 43, I want to bid competitively to maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overpayment. In previous rounds, winning bids were often higher than the prize's common value but securing the win with a bid close to the perceived value has helped maximize profit. A bid of 38 should be competitive while leaving a safe margin below my perceived value to ensure a positive profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 63 and analyzing the patterns from previous rounds, both Betty and Charles often place high bids, frequently close to or above their perceived values. To be competitive and have a high chance of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin, a bid of 60 balances out the risk and reward. This is based on the previous round where I successfully maximized profit with a bid close to my value while accounting for high second-highest bids.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 56 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 60', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 24, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 24. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, I need to bid an amount that balances a high chance of winning the bid with ensuring a positive profit margin. Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 23, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 23 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous round, where the bids were 25, 24, and 20, and considering my value towards the prize is 23 in this round, I should bid conservatively. Bidding 20 moves to ensure I have a chance to win without risking a bid too high, which could result in a negative profit. Given the history, a bid of 20 stands a reasonable chance of winning and maximizes the potential for a positive profit margin since it is close to the lower end of the bidding spectrum observed.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 34.\\nYour total profit is 34. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 40, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 34.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 81, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. Based on the previous rounds, we saw bids ranging from 18 to 25, which shows some competitiveness but not extreme. Therefore, bidding 79 would likely secure the win while ensuring my profit is maximized by keeping the second-highest bid (which I expect to be around 20-25) lower, thus resulting in substantial profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly less than my perceived value while still being within a competitive range can help maximize profit. In Round 0, I bid 24 with a value of 33, and the winning bid was slightly higher. In Round 1, a bid of 20 with a value of 23 didn't win, but the winning bid was only slightly higher. In Round 2, I bid aggressively at 79 with a high value of 81 to secure the win. This suggests that a competitive bid slightly below my perceived value can be suitable. Therefore, bidding 20 with a value of 26 balances the risk and maximizes the chance of winning with a profit margin.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 28. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 55, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, where aggressive bidding sometimes led to high profits (as seen in Round 2 with a bid of 79), and conservative bidding didn't always ensure wins (as seen in Rounds 0 and 1), I\u2019ll balance between them. Given my value of 67, I'll bid 58. This is competitive enough to likely win, considering earlier rounds' bids, while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 85, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 40. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 90, I want to ensure I have a high chance of winning by bidding close to my perceived value. From past rounds, we have seen that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value ensures securing the prize. For instance, in round 2, a high bid of 79 with a value of 81 secured a win with a substantial profit due to the significantly lower second-highest bid. Therefore, bidding 85 should secure the win while leaving room for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower, as observed in previous bids such as 40, 20, or 58.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 65, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I need to bid close to my perceived value to ensure a high chance of winning. In previous rounds, I've observed that aggressive bidding around the high perceived value secures the prize and often results in a significantly lower second-highest bid. For instance, in round 5, a bid of 85 with a value of 90 secured a win with a positive profit. To maximize profit while ensuring a win, I will bid 80, which is slightly lower than my perceived value but competitive enough based on previous bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 39. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I want to apply a strategy that balances competitiveness with profitability. Reviewing previous rounds, we observe that aggressively high bids secure wins but can risk lower profits. Therefore, a slightly conservative bid of 54 might encourage winning by undercutting the maximum value, yet staying competitive enough based on the historical range of second-highest bids, typically around the mid-50s to 60s. This approach aims to maximize my total profit by preventing overbidding while increasing the probability of securing the prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 51 in this round, I need to consider past rounds' bidding behavior to maximize profit. In previous rounds, aggressive bids close to perceived values often secured wins; however, they sometimes resulted in marginal or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 47 is competitive, considering the historical bid ranges (e.g., bids around mid-40s to mid-50s), and allows a buffer to secure a win without significantly risking overpayment. This balance increases the likelihood of winning while maintaining a positive profit margin.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 62, 62. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 70, I aim to maximize my profit while ensuring a strong chance of winning. Previous rounds indicate aggressive but slightly conservative bids often secure the prize with a good margin. For example, in round 4, a bid close to the perceived value (58 with a value of 67) secured the win profitably. Therefore, I choose to bid 62, which is competitive enough within my perceived value range, yet still aims to leave a profit based on the expected behavior of other bidders.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize this round, I strategically aim to balance competitiveness with profitability. Reflecting on previous rounds, conservative bids slightly below the perceived value have shown reasonable chances of winning while ensuring the possibility of positive profits. For instance, in round 9, a bid close to but not exceeding the perceived value helped secure good profit margins. Therefore, bidding 36 provides competitiveness without severely risking overpayment, increasing the likelihood of securing the prize profitably.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 88, previous rounds have shown that aggressive bidding close to my perceived value often secures the prize but sometimes results in minimal or negative profits due to the high second-highest bids. For example, in rounds where I bid closer to my value, like 85 out of 90, I had positive if not optimal profits. Balancing competitiveness with profitability, I should bid 74, which is competitive yet conservative enough to likely secure a win and avoid too high a payment, maximizing the chances for a positive profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 36. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 45, I want to place a bid that is competitive but still allows a buffer for profit. Reviewing prior rounds, bids slightly below the perceived value have shown success in securing the prize with positive profits, even if not maximized, while avoiding overpayment. A bid of 40 provides a strong chance to win against bids typically ranging in the mid-to-high range while leaving room for a reasonable profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 63, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 70 for this round, I want to strike a balance between competitiveness and profitability. Previous rounds indicate that slightly conservative bids close to my value have had success (e.g., bidding 74 on a value of 88 led to profit). Bids in the low to mid-60s have typically been competitive without excessively reducing profits by overbidding. Therefore, a bid of 63 should give me a strong chance to win while maximizing my profit potential if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 60 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 33', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14, I want to place a strategic bid that gives me a chance to win while minimizing the risk. Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15. By bidding 10, I aim to maximize my total profit if I win, without overbidding and losing value.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 50.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 70, I want to place a strategic bid that gives me a chance to win while minimizing the risk. In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that competitive bids tend to range between 10 and 52. Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 35, and observing the past bids by Andy and Betty, a competitive but not overly high bid around 20-30 seems suitable. Previous rounds showed second-highest bids of 50, 30, and 20. To balance my chances of winning and maximizing profit, I will bid 22 to potentially win at a lower cost, considering the moderate to high bids of the other players in past rounds.'

Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15. By bidding 10, I aim to maximize my total profit if I win, without overbidding and losing value.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 70, I want to place a strategic bid that gives me a chance to win while minimizing the risk. In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that competitive bids tend to range between 10 and 52. Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 35, and observing the past bids by Andy and Betty, a competitive but not overly high bid around 20-30 seems suitable. Previous rounds showed second-highest bids of 50, 30, and 20. To balance my chances of winning and maximizing profit, I will bid 22 to potentially win at a lower cost, considering the moderate to high bids of the other players in past rounds.'

Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15.

In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.'

Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.'

Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15. By bidding 10, I aim to maximize my total profit if I win, without overbidding and losing value.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20.

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that competitive bids tend to range between 10 and 52. Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.'

Previous rounds showed second-highest bids of 50, 30, and 20. To balance my chances of winning and maximizing profit, I will bid 22 to potentially win at a lower cost, considering the moderate to high bids of the other players in past rounds.'

By bidding 20, I aim to have a chance at winning the prize while keeping my bid conservative enough to maximize my total profit should I win.'

Bidding 29 allows me to stay competitive but also balance the risk of overpaying.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 62, I aim to bid high enough to win but ensure my profit margin. From the history, bids can be competitive. By bidding 50, I hope to outbid Andy and Charles without overspending, assuming their values and bids might still be slightly lower.'

Previous rounds show that bids often fall close to the value. By bidding 30, I aim to have a competitive bid that is below my perceived value to ensure potential profit, assuming the second-highest bid might be lower than my bid.'

The history shows that bids can be quite close to the perceived value. By bidding 20, I aim to stay in the race without risking too much, assuming Andy and Charles may bid around or slightly above this range based on the previous rounds.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 53, I aim to bid enough to be competitive but still leave room for profit. From the previous rounds, the winning bids vary and are often close to the perceived value, but I have not won yet and remained with a total profit of 0. A bid of 48 allows me to be competitive while minimizing the risk of paying too much above the second-highest bid.'

Bidding 20 keeps me in the race while minimizing the risk of overcommitting and aligns with previous successful strategies where the second-highest bid was often close to this range.'

From the history of previous rounds, I have noticed that bidding approximately two-thirds of my value typically ensures competitiveness without overcommitting.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my total profit, I will bid slightly below my value, which is 24. By doing so, I reduce the risk of overpaying while maintaining a strong chance of winning the prize. Based on previous rounds, this strategy should help optimize my earnings.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 73, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring I don't overpay compared to the likely value of the second-highest bid. Based on previous rounds where bids were 20, 10, and 10, it's clear that bidding significantly lower than my perceived value might still win the prize. 50 seems like a strategic bid to maximize profit while staying competitive.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 37 for this round, I aim to place a competitive bid that is slightly below my value. This approach balances the potential overbidding risk while maintaining a good chance of winning. Based on bidding patterns from previous rounds, bids from other players tend to be relatively competitive. A bid of 35 minimizes the risk of overpayment while keeping me a strong contender for the prize.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value towards the prize is 37, I want to place a competitive yet conservative bid to avoid overpaying. From previous rounds, I observed that bids can vary widely, but aiming for a bid slightly lower than my perceived value while staying competitive is crucial. A bid of 28 should provide a good balance between potentially winning the auction and ensuring that I do not overpay relative to the second highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly closer to my perceived value often led to minimal or negative profits. Given my perceived value of 51, I'll choose a more conservative bid of 40. This aims to maximize my profit by minimizing the risk of overpaying, while still being competitive enough to have a good chance of winning against Betty and Charles.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for this round and observing previous rounds where the second-highest bids have been relatively lower (e.g., 20, 30, 20, 40), I will place a more conservative bid. Bidding 10 minimizes my risk of overbidding while still providing a chance to win if others bid very low. This strategy helps in managing my total profit by reducing potential losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 28, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, bids from other players have ranged widely but a pattern of competitive yet conservative bidding below perceived value has emerged. Given my perceived value of 36, a bid of 28 aims to balance being competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous successful bids tended to be moderately below perceived values, thus a bid of 28 should optimize the balance between winning the auction and ensuring profitable returns.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 44, I aim to place a competitive bid that is below my value to minimize the risk of overpayment while maintaining a strong chance of winning. Analyzing previous rounds, bids have varied but often stayed below perceived values. By bidding 33, I balance being competitive with the goal of maximizing total profit by reducing potential losses from overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 32, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 32. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've noticed that winning bids tend to be slightly below the perceived values, often by a significant amount. Given my perceived value of 42, I will bid 32. This aims to place me competitively while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This conservative approach should help in maximizing my total profit by reducing potential losses, similar to strategies used in earlier rounds, such as when I bid 28 in round 7 with a perceived value of 44.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 50, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I want to place a competitive bid that is below my value to reduce the risk of overpaying while maintaining a strong chance of winning. Based on previous rounds, I observed that bidding moderately below my perceived value often leads to better profit outcomes. Therefore, bidding 43 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 40, 35.

Based on previous rounds, successful bids have typically been moderately below the perceived values. Therefore, bidding 40 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by reducing the likelihood of paying too much relative to the second-highest bidder.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 45.

Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15. By bidding 10, I aim to maximize my total profit if I win, without overbidding and losing value.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that competitive bids tend to range between 10 and 52. Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.'

Previous rounds showed second-highest bids of 50, 30, and 20. To balance my chances of winning and maximizing profit, I will bid 22 to potentially win at a lower cost, considering the moderate to high bids of the other players in past rounds.'

Bidding 29 allows me to stay competitive but also balance the risk of overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 37 for this round, I aim to place a competitive bid that is slightly below my value. This approach balances the potential overbidding risk while maintaining a good chance of winning. Based on bidding patterns from previous rounds, bids from other players tend to be relatively competitive. A bid of 35 minimizes the risk of overpayment while keeping me a strong contender for the prize.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value towards the prize is 37, I want to place a competitive yet conservative bid to avoid overpaying. From previous rounds, I observed that bids can vary widely, but aiming for a bid slightly lower than my perceived value while staying competitive is crucial. A bid of 28 should provide a good balance between potentially winning the auction and ensuring that I do not overpay relative to the second highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding significantly closer to my perceived value often led to minimal or negative profits. Given my perceived value of 51, I'll choose a more conservative bid of 40. This aims to maximize my profit by minimizing the risk of overpaying, while still being competitive enough to have a good chance of winning against Betty and Charles.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for this round and observing previous rounds where the second-highest bids have been relatively lower (e.g., 20, 30, 20, 40), I will place a more conservative bid. Bidding 10 minimizes my risk of overbidding while still providing a chance to win if others bid very low. This strategy helps in managing my total profit by reducing potential losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 28, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, bids from other players have ranged widely but a pattern of competitive yet conservative bidding below perceived value has emerged. Given my perceived value of 36, a bid of 28 aims to balance being competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Previous successful bids tended to be moderately below perceived values, thus a bid of 28 should optimize the balance between winning the auction and ensuring profitable returns.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 44, I aim to place a competitive bid that is below my value to minimize the risk of overpayment while maintaining a strong chance of winning. Analyzing previous rounds, bids have varied but often stayed below perceived values. By bidding 33, I balance being competitive with the goal of maximizing total profit by reducing potential losses from overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 32, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 32. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, I've noticed that winning bids tend to be slightly below the perceived values, often by a significant amount. Given my perceived value of 42, I will bid 32. This aims to place me competitively while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This conservative approach should help in maximizing my total profit by reducing potential losses, similar to strategies used in earlier rounds, such as when I bid 28 in round 7 with a perceived value of 44.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 50, 43.

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I want to place a competitive bid that is below my value to reduce the risk of overpaying while maintaining a strong chance of winning. Based on previous rounds, I observed that bidding moderately below my perceived value often leads to better profit outcomes. Therefore, bidding 43 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 40, 35.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 56, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid to minimize the risk of overpaying while maintaining a strong chance of winning. Based on previous rounds, successful bids have typically been moderately below the perceived values. Therefore, bidding 40 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by reducing the likelihood of paying too much relative to the second-highest bidder.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 60, I want to bid competitively but conservatively to maximize profit while mitigating the risk of overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds, the second highest bids often fall significantly lower than the highest. Assuming my competitors follow similar patterns, bidding 48 strikes a balance between offering a strong bid and avoiding excessive payment if I win.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 45.

Based on previous rounds, I have observed that bids significantly below the perceived value often yield better outcomes. For example, in round 9, with a perceived value of 67, I bid 43 and managed to be the second-highest bid. Therefore, in this round, bidding 45 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by minimizing the risk of overpayment.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 32, 29.

In previous rounds, I've observed that bidding slightly below my perceived value often yields better outcomes.

Since I don't have the specific bid history of Andy and Betty, I'll estimate their bids to be around 10-15. By bidding 10, I aim to maximize my total profit if I win, without overbidding and losing value.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 70, I want to place a strategic bid that gives me a chance to win while minimizing the risk. In round 0, the highest bid was 20, which suggests that the other bidders (Andy and Betty) may bid conservatively. However, since my value is significantly higher this round, I need to increase my bid to secure the prize. By bidding 52, I aim to win the prize while hopefully paying a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I've noticed that competitive bids tend to range between 10 and 52. Given my value for the prize is 24, I should place a conservative bid to maximize profit potential. Since the highest bid in the previous round was 52 and the second-highest was 50, a bid of 20 gives me a chance to win while minimizing my expenditure, aiming to balance winning and profit maximization.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing the past rounds, Andy and Betty's bids tend to be competitive but not extremely high. Given my value of 19, bidding slightly below my full value at 17 allows a chance to win while still aiming to maximize my total profit by not overbidding.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 35, and observing the past bids by Andy and Betty, a competitive but not overly high bid around 20-30 seems suitable. Previous rounds showed second-highest bids of 50, 30, and 20. To balance my chances of winning and maximizing profit, I will bid 22 to potentially win at a lower cost, considering the moderate to high bids of the other players in past rounds.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22 and analyzing the previous bidding patterns, Andy and Betty tend to place competitive bids that range between 20 and 48. By bidding 20, I aim to have a chance at winning the prize while keeping my bid conservative enough to maximize my total profit should I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 28, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 33 for the prize and the bidding patterns observed in the previous rounds, where Andy and Betty's bids ranged from 10 to 48, I aim to place a competitive bid to maximize my chances of winning while trying to keep a margin for profit. Bidding 29 allows me to stay competitive but also balance the risk of overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 40 for the prize and analyzing the previous bidding patterns of Andy and Betty, their bids tend to range between 10 and 48. To maximize my total profit, I should place a competitive bid that is close to but less than my perceived value to ensure a potential win while minimizing overpaying. Thus, bidding 35 balances the chance to win with minimizing potential losses.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 32, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 32. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 59 for this round and analyzing the historical bids of Andy and Betty, their bids typically range from 20 to 48. To maximize my profit, I should place a competitive bid close to my value to ensure I win while minimizing overpaying. By bidding 52, I aim to outbid the highest bids observed while keeping a margin for a higher second-highest bid, thus maximizing the potential profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 50, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize and analyzing the historical bidding patterns of Andy and Betty, their bids typically range from 20 to 48. To maximize my profit this round, I should place a competitive bid that is high enough to outbid the others but leaves enough margin to remain profitable considering the second-highest bid. By bidding 50, I aim to balance the likelihood of winning with the potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 59 for the prize, I want to place a bid that gives me a good chance of winning while leaving room to maximize my profit based on the highest and second-highest bids from previous rounds. Historical data shows Andy and Betty's bids tend to range from 20 to 50, with second-highest bids typically around 30-50. A bid of 50 should competitively position me to win while considering a reasonable payment if I do.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 55 for the prize and reviewing the bid history, Andy and Betty's bids tend to range between 20 and 50, with second-highest bids generally around 30-50. To maximize my chance of winning while ensuring that I minimize overpaying, a bid of 45 strategically positions me to potentially win without excessively compromising profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 45.

The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for the prize and considering the bids from previous rounds where Andy and Betty's bids typically range from 20 to 50, a bid of 45 should competitively position me to win while minimizing overpayment. This bid also leaves room for profit based on my perceived value.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 32, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 33 for the prize and observing the bid patterns of Andy and Betty, where competitive bids range between 20 and 50, I should place a competitive bid that's close to but below my value for maximizing profit while winning. A bid of 29 positions me well to win while minimizing the chance of overbidding.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 37 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.'

For instance, in round 0, the bids were 6, 19, and 10, where the winning bid of 6 was quite low. In round 1, the second-highest bid was 79 compared to the highest of 85. In round 2, the second-highest bid was 59. To maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 48 should be competitive enough to win but leaves room to avoid negative profit from overestimation.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 68 and based on the history where other bids tend to range significantly lower than the perceived value, bidding around 59 allows me to maximize my profit by ensuring that my bid is competitive but lower than my perceived value to avoid overly negative profits. For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.'

For instance, in round 0, the bids were 6, 19, and 10, where the winning bid of 6 was quite low. In round 1, the second-highest bid was 79 compared to the highest of 85. In round 2, the second-highest bid was 59. To maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 48 should be competitive enough to win but leaves room to avoid negative profit from overestimation.'

This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically.

This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the bidding patterns in previous rounds, where successful bids ranged between 50 and 85, and typically the second-highest bid being significantly lower, bidding 60 should offer a balance between being competitive and allowing for a profit margin. My value towards the prize is 66, and this bid leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid isn't too far below 60.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 20, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round is 23, I aim to maximize my profit by bidding slightly lower than my perceived value. The history shows bids close to the total values have led to either breaking even or slight profits. By bidding 20, I hope to be competitive enough to win while ensuring I don't overbid and risk a loss if the common value is lower or close to the second-highest bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11, I need to bid cautiously to avoid a scenario where I overbid and reduce my profit. Observing the previous rounds, I noticed that bidding slightly below my perceived value can still make me competitive while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Therefore, I will bid 10 to balance the competitiveness and potential profit.'

I plan to bid slightly below my value, at 40, to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, my profit remains maximized even if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30.

The highest bids tend to win, but bidding too high can lead to minimal profits or losses.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 68 and based on the history where other bids tend to range significantly lower than the perceived value, bidding around 59 allows me to maximize my profit by ensuring that my bid is competitive but lower than my perceived value to avoid overly negative profits. For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 57, analyzing previous rounds shows a pattern where bids often fall below the perceived value. For instance, in round 0, the bids were 6, 19, and 10, where the winning bid of 6 was quite low. In round 1, the second-highest bid was 79 compared to the highest of 85. In round 2, the second-highest bid was 59. To maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 48 should be competitive enough to win but leaves room to avoid negative profit from overestimation.'

This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically.

For example, in the first round, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived values. Similarly, in round 3, the highest bid was slightly above the second-highest one. By bidding 12, I am staying competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding, thus maximizing potential profit or minimizing potential loss.'

For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough. Bidding 42 should keep me competitive while reducing the risk of overbidding and thus maximizing my chances of a positive profit.'

For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off.

I am cautious about the high bids since they can lead to losses if I win with an excessively high bid. Adjusting my bid based on this cautious strategy can help maximize my profit across multiple rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71, and considering the previous rounds where winning bids were significantly high (79 in round 1 and 10 in round 0), I aim to place a competitive but more conservative bid. Bidding 60 provides a good balance to likely secure the win while optimizing my profit margin considering the second-highest bids and potential common values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, I've noticed that bidding close to my perceived value but leaving enough margin can maximize my profit. Given my value of 55 in this round, I will bid 50, which aims to be competitive while being cautious of overbidding and reducing my profits due to the second-highest bid payment.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the bidding patterns in previous rounds, where successful bids ranged between 50 and 85, and typically the second-highest bid being significantly lower, bidding 60 should offer a balance between being competitive and allowing for a profit margin. My value towards the prize is 66, and this bid leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid isn't too far below 60.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round is 23, I aim to maximize my profit by bidding slightly lower than my perceived value. The history shows bids close to the total values have led to either breaking even or slight profits. By bidding 20, I hope to be competitive enough to win while ensuring I don't overbid and risk a loss if the common value is lower or close to the second-highest bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11, I need to bid cautiously to avoid a scenario where I overbid and reduce my profit. Observing the previous rounds, I noticed that bidding slightly below my perceived value can still make me competitive while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Therefore, I will bid 10 to balance the competitiveness and potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 41 and the history of previous rounds shows that the highest bids often win but can lead to minimal profit margins or even losses if too high, I am adjusting my strategy. I plan to bid slightly below my value, at 40, to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, my profit remains maximized even if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44 and the history of previous rounds, a pattern shows that bidding slightly below my perceived value often provides a balance between competitiveness and maximizing profit. The highest bids tend to win, but bidding too high can lead to minimal profits or losses. Therefore, bidding 40 should give me a good chance of winning while leaving some margin for profit based on the second-highest bid. This strategy has previously yielded optimal outcomes while managing risk effectively.'

For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.'

For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough. Bidding 42 should keep me competitive while reducing the risk of overbidding and thus maximizing my chances of a positive profit.'

For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off. Thus, bidding 35 aligns with these observations and provides a competitive edge without risking substantial negative profit.'

Bidding 30 gives a reasonable chance of winning while leaving room for profit, as it is below my perceived value and competitive enough to potentially win without overpaying.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 48, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 64, I aim to maximize my total profit by balancing the chance of winning and ensuring a potential profit. In previous rounds, winning bids ranged from 6 to 85, with second-highest bids being significant (19, 79, and 59 respectively). By bidding 35, I position myself with a competitive yet cautious bid, considering the aggressive nature of the other bidders. This bid provides a reasonable chance of securing the prize without significantly overpaying.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 65, I want to increase my bid slightly compared to previous rounds to have a better chance of winning while still securing a positive profit. Previous winning bids have ranged from 6 to 85, with a general trend of aggressive bidding. By bidding 45, I place a competitive yet prudent bid that balances the risk of overpaying with the probability of winning, considering the other bidders' behavior.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 20, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 18 for this round, I want to balance the potential of winning with securing a positive profit margin. Based on previous rounds, overall bids have been aggressive, often well above half of the perceived values. By bidding 9, I position myself with a cautious yet competitive bid that could win if my competitors' perceived values are significantly lower, while minimizing the loss if I do not win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11 in this round, I will set my bid lower than half of my perceived value to preserve a chance of profit while minimizing potential losses. Based on the previous rounds, aggressive bidding patterns from Betty and Charles indicate that bids typically are higher. Hence, a more conservative bid of 5 positions me to avoid overpaying while still providing a slim chance of winning if their values are low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 40, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 and taking into account the previous rounds, the winning bids have often been quite aggressive. Bidding 30 allows me to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win the prize and minimizing the risk of overpaying relative to the perceived value and the expected second-highest bid.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 47 for this round and considering the previous rounds, where aggressive bidding has been common, a bid of 30 strikes a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying. This strategy aims to secure the prize without significantly sacrificing my potential profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 21 and analyzing the pattern from previous rounds, I notice that aggressive bidding often leads to overpaying, while more conservative bids around half to slightly below half of my perceived value can provide a competitive edge. By bidding 10, I aim to balance the chance of winning with minimizing the risk of overpaying, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 56, and observing the aggressive nature of bidding from previous rounds where winning bids have been significantly higher, I want to be competitive yet cautious. Bidding 38 leverages a roughly 2/3 split of my perceived value, balancing the probability of winning with a margin for profit.

I am cautious about the high bids since they can lead to losses if I win with an excessively high bid. Adjusting my bid based on this cautious strategy can help maximize my profit across multiple rounds.'

Given my value of 55 in this round, I will bid 50, which aims to be competitive while being cautious of overbidding and reducing my profits due to the second-highest bid payment.'

This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically.

For example, in the first round, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived values. Similarly, in round 3, the highest bid was slightly above the second-highest one.

For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough.

In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44 and analyzing previous rounds, bids that win are typically slightly lower than the perceived values while still being competitive. For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off. Thus, bidding 35 aligns with these observations and provides a competitive edge without risking substantial negative profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 11 and looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to be lower than the perceived values but still competitive. For example, in the last round with a similar perceived value range, conservative bidding strategies close to but lower than the maximum perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 8 should keep me competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding and ensuring I do not incur significant negative profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I noticed that bids in previous rounds typically need to be around 10 units lower than the perceived value to remain competitive without overbidding. For instance, in Round 1, my bid of 85 was close to the second-highest bid of 79, showing this tendency. Similarly, in Round 8, a bid of 35 competed well with the highest bid of 40 when my perceived value was 44. Therefore, bidding 57 should allow me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of a negative profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 49 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

Based on previous rounds and common auction strategies, placing a bid around half my value (6) could provide a balance between winning the prize and securing a positive profit. If Betty or Charles have a lower perceived value, my bid could still win, while if they have a higher value, their bids would exceed mine, minimizing my potential loss.'

Based on previous winning bids (6, 19, 10) and the competition's behavior, bidding around 35 seems strategically sound. It balances my need to secure the prize and ensures I minimize potential overpayment relative to previous bids.'

Considering previous rounds, where bids ranged from 6 to 85, I can infer that my competitors\u2019 bids are somewhat aggressive.

In previous rounds, winning bids ranged from 6 to 85, with second-highest bids being significant (19, 79, and 59 respectively). By bidding 35, I position myself with a competitive yet cautious bid, considering the aggressive nature of the other bidders.

Based on previous rounds, overall bids have been aggressive, often well above half of the perceived values. By bidding 9, I position myself with a cautious yet competitive bid that could win if my competitors' perceived values are significantly lower, while minimizing the loss if I do not win.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 56, and observing the aggressive nature of bidding from previous rounds where winning bids have been significantly higher, I want to be competitive yet cautious. Bidding 38 leverages a roughly 2/3 split of my perceived value, balancing the probability of winning with a margin for profit. This approach takes into account the previous trends of high second-highest bids, aiming to maximize my total profit by tempering aggression with prudence.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I want to bid lower than my perceived value of 29, given that I don't know the exact bids of Andy and Betty. A bid of 19 provides a safe cushion ensuring I do not bid excessively high, thus avoiding potential negative profit.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 95 and considering the history where the winning bid tends to be lower than the perceived value, I should bid slightly lower to avoid overbidding. A bid of 85 provides a strategic cushion ensuring I maximize my chances of winning without risking a significantly negative profit in case the second-highest bid is considerably lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 68 and based on the history where other bids tend to range significantly lower than the perceived value, bidding around 59 allows me to maximize my profit by ensuring that my bid is competitive but lower than my perceived value to avoid overly negative profits. For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 57, analyzing previous rounds shows a pattern where bids often fall below the perceived value. For instance, in round 0, the bids were 6, 19, and 10, where the winning bid of 6 was quite low. In round 1, the second-highest bid was 79 compared to the highest of 85. In round 2, the second-highest bid was 59. To maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 48 should be competitive enough to win but leaves room to avoid negative profit from overestimation.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, a competitive but safe bid approach has been to bid approximately 10 units lower than my perceived value. This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically. Hence, bidding 53 this round should enable me to stay competitive without risking a high payment that could offset my gains.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 16 this round, I should bid conservatively considering the previous rounds' outcomes. For example, in the first round, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived values. Similarly, in round 3, the highest bid was slightly above the second-highest one. By bidding 12, I am staying competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding, thus maximizing potential profit or minimizing potential loss.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9, and analyzing prior rounds where the winning bids have consistently been significantly lower than the perceived values, bidding a conservative amount of 6 should increase my chances of winning without overbidding. This strategy ensures I do not risk a negative profit in this round while remaining competitive.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 40, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 51, previous rounds indicate that the highest bid is often significantly lower than the perceived value. For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough. Bidding 42 should keep me competitive while reducing the risk of overbidding and thus maximizing my chances of a positive profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44 and analyzing previous rounds, bids that win are typically slightly lower than the perceived values while still being competitive. For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off. Thus, bidding 35 aligns with these observations and provides a competitive edge without risking substantial negative profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 11 and looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to be lower than the perceived values but still competitive. For example, in the last round with a similar perceived value range, conservative bidding strategies close to but lower than the maximum perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 8 should keep me competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding and ensuring I do not incur significant negative profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I noticed that bids in previous rounds typically need to be around 10 units lower than the perceived value to remain competitive without overbidding. For instance, in Round 1, my bid of 85 was close to the second-highest bid of 79, showing this tendency. Similarly, in Round 8, a bid of 35 competed well with the highest bid of 40 when my perceived value was 44. Therefore, bidding 57 should allow me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of a negative profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 30, 25.

I am cautious about the high bids since they can lead to losses if I win with an excessively high bid. Adjusting my bid based on this cautious strategy can help maximize my profit across multiple rounds.'

Bidding 60 provides a good balance to likely secure the win while optimizing my profit margin considering the second-highest bids and potential common values.'

Given my value of 55 in this round, I will bid 50, which aims to be competitive while being cautious of overbidding and reducing my profits due to the second-highest bid payment.'

My value towards the prize is 66, and this bid leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid isn't too far below 60.'

The history shows bids close to the total values have led to either breaking even or slight profits. By bidding 20, I hope to be competitive enough to win while ensuring I don't overbid and risk a loss if the common value is lower or close to the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11, I need to bid cautiously to avoid a scenario where I overbid and reduce my profit. Observing the previous rounds, I noticed that bidding slightly below my perceived value can still make me competitive while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Therefore, I will bid 10 to balance the competitiveness and potential profit.'

I plan to bid slightly below my value, at 40, to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, my profit remains maximized even if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

The highest bids tend to win, but bidding too high can lead to minimal profits or losses. Therefore, bidding 40 should give me a good chance of winning while leaving some margin for profit based on the second-highest bid. This strategy has previously yielded optimal outcomes while managing risk effectively.'

Considering the common trend where the highest bids often win with some margin left by the second-highest bids, bidding 55 should give me a strong chance to win while maximizing my total profit by leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid isn't too close.'

For example, in the first round, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived values. Similarly, in round 3, the highest bid was slightly above the second-highest one. By bidding 12, I am staying competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding, thus maximizing potential profit or minimizing potential loss.'

For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough. Bidding 42 should keep me competitive while reducing the risk of overbidding and thus maximizing my chances of a positive profit.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44 and analyzing previous rounds, bids that win are typically slightly lower than the perceived values while still being competitive. For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off. Thus, bidding 35 aligns with these observations and provides a competitive edge without risking substantial negative profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 15, 10.

For example, in the last round with a similar perceived value range, conservative bidding strategies close to but lower than the maximum perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 8 should keep me competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding and ensuring I do not incur significant negative profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I noticed that bids in previous rounds typically need to be around 10 units lower than the perceived value to remain competitive without overbidding. For instance, in Round 1, my bid of 85 was close to the second-highest bid of 79, showing this tendency. Similarly, in Round 8, a bid of 35 competed well with the highest bid of 40 when my perceived value was 44.

In previous rounds, winning bids ranged from 6 to 85, with second-highest bids being significant (19, 79, and 59 respectively).

Based on previous rounds, overall bids have been aggressive, often well above half of the perceived values.

Bidding 38 leverages a roughly 2/3 split of my perceived value, balancing the probability of winning with a margin for profit. This approach takes into account the previous trends of high second-highest bids, aiming to maximize my total profit by tempering aggression with prudence.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 19. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I want to bid lower than my perceived value of 29, given that I don't know the exact bids of Andy and Betty. A bid of 19 provides a safe cushion ensuring I do not bid excessively high, thus avoiding potential negative profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 95 and considering the history where the winning bid tends to be lower than the perceived value, I should bid slightly lower to avoid overbidding. A bid of 85 provides a strategic cushion ensuring I maximize my chances of winning without risking a significantly negative profit in case the second-highest bid is considerably lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 68 and based on the history where other bids tend to range significantly lower than the perceived value, bidding around 59 allows me to maximize my profit by ensuring that my bid is competitive but lower than my perceived value to avoid overly negative profits. For instance, in the first round, the highest bid followed by the second-highest was around a 9-10 unit difference, so a similar strategy could work here.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 48, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 57, analyzing previous rounds shows a pattern where bids often fall below the perceived value. For instance, in round 0, the bids were 6, 19, and 10, where the winning bid of 6 was quite low. In round 1, the second-highest bid was 79 compared to the highest of 85. In round 2, the second-highest bid was 59. To maximize profit without overbidding, a bid of 48 should be competitive enough to win but leaves room to avoid negative profit from overestimation.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, a competitive but safe bid approach has been to bid approximately 10 units lower than my perceived value. This strategy allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of negative profit. For instance, in Round 2, I bid 59 with a perceived value of 68, and the highest winning bid was 60, very close to my bid but not exceeding drastically. Hence, bidding 53 this round should enable me to stay competitive without risking a high payment that could offset my gains.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 16 this round, I should bid conservatively considering the previous rounds' outcomes. For example, in the first round, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived values. Similarly, in round 3, the highest bid was slightly above the second-highest one. By bidding 12, I am staying competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding, thus maximizing potential profit or minimizing potential loss.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9, and analyzing prior rounds where the winning bids have consistently been significantly lower than the perceived values, bidding a conservative amount of 6 should increase my chances of winning without overbidding. This strategy ensures I do not risk a negative profit in this round while remaining competitive.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 40, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 51, previous rounds indicate that the highest bid is often significantly lower than the perceived value. For example, in rounds where my perceived value was high, a lower bid like 10-12 units less was competitive enough. Bidding 42 should keep me competitive while reducing the risk of overbidding and thus maximizing my chances of a positive profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44 and analyzing previous rounds, bids that win are typically slightly lower than the perceived values while still being competitive. For example, in round 1, a bid lower than the perceived value won, showing the importance of not overbidding. Similarly, in rounds where I bid conservatively but still maintained a reasonable range close to my perceived value, the strategy paid off. Thus, bidding 35 aligns with these observations and provides a competitive edge without risking substantial negative profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 11 and looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to be lower than the perceived values but still competitive. For example, in the last round with a similar perceived value range, conservative bidding strategies close to but lower than the maximum perceived value have been effective. Therefore, bidding 8 should keep me competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding and ensuring I do not incur significant negative profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I noticed that bids in previous rounds typically need to be around 10 units lower than the perceived value to remain competitive without overbidding. For instance, in Round 1, my bid of 85 was close to the second-highest bid of 79, showing this tendency. Similarly, in Round 8, a bid of 35 competed well with the highest bid of 40 when my perceived value was 44. Therefore, bidding 57 should allow me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of a negative profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 49, analyzing previous rounds shows that competitive bids tend to be around 10 units lower than the perceived value. For example, in rounds with perceived values close to mine, bids around 8-10 units lower were competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Therefore, bidding 40 should keep me competitive while maximizing my total profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 48, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 57 and analyzing previous rounds, winning bids often fall below the perceived value by around 8-10 units. For instance, in round 3 with a perceived value of 57, I bid 48 and came close to winning. Similarly, in round 11 with a perceived value of 49, my bid of 40 secured a win. Therefore, a bid of 48 should keep me competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding and maximizing my potential profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 4, 15, 15.

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 19 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, winning bids have typically been lower than the perceived value but still competitive. For instance, in round 1, a bid 10 units lower than the perceived value won. In multiple rounds, my strategy of bidding approximately 4 to 10 units lower has been effective.

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit.

Based on past rounds, bids varied significantly, with highest bids such as 45, 10, and 52 in rounds 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit. A bid of 20 strikes a balance, making me somewhat competitive without risking a significant loss if I do not win.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 0. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My perceived value for the prize is very low at only 1. Given the history of previous rounds, where other bids have been significantly higher, I should strategically bid 0 to avoid negative profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 38, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and the history where higher bids won but didn't always lead to significant profits, I will bid slightly lower to ensure a potential profit if I win and the second-highest bid is somewhat lower. A bid of 38 should balance a high probability of winning with a reasonable chance of profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 51 for the prize and analyzing the bid history where bids tend to be quite competitive, I want to ensure I have a good chance of winning. However, I also want to maximize my profit if I do win. Bidding 47 should strike a balance, significantly increasing my chances of winning while still allowing for a reasonable margin of profit based on the second-highest bids observed in previous rounds.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 16, I want to ensure that my bid balances the potential profit and the likelihood of winning. In previous rounds, bids have been competitive, often resulting in the highest bidder facing a minimal profit. Since my value is relatively low this round, I will bid below my perceived value to avoid overbidding and minimize the risk of a zero or negative profit. A bid of 10 should give me a chance to win the auction while maintaining a potential profit margin.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 2, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is quite low at 8, I should bid conservatively to avoid negative profit. Looking at previous rounds, bidding significantly below my value can still potentially yield the prize if the other bidders have similarly low values. My bid of 2 balances the potential to win the prize with minimal risk of losing profit.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 65, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 81, and analyzing the history of previous rounds where bids have been high and competitive, I want to bid aggressively enough to have a good chance of winning while still allowing for a high potential profit. A bid of 68 balances the likelihood of winning the auction with the potential to subtract the second-highest bid from my value, creating a solid profit margin.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55 and analyzing the history where bids are competitive but often slightly below the perceived values, bidding 50 seems optimal. This bid is high enough to give me a strong chance of winning while still leaving a potential profit margin when subtracting the second-highest bid from my value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 49 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, other bidders have often bid aggressively but typically below their perceived values. To maximize my total profit, I will bid 44. This amount is slightly below my value, ensuring I have a good chance of winning while leaving a potential profit when subtracting the second-highest bid from my value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 55 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit.

A bid of 38 should balance a high probability of winning with a reasonable chance of profit.'

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 0. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my low value for the prize at 13, I will bid conservatively. My aim is to increase my chances of a profitable win if my competitors bid low, while minimizing potential loss if I don't win. A bid of 10 is close but comfortably lower than my prize value, keeping my potential loss small.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 38, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66, I want to bid an amount that gives me a good chance to win while maintaining a profit margin. From the previous rounds, it is evident that bids can vary significantly. In round 0, the highest bid was 45, and in round 1, the highest was 10. Therefore, a bid of 52 is strategically higher than those in previous rounds but still well below my prize value of 66, ensuring that if I win, I will likely make a profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 62, I aim to bid at a level that balances a high chance of winning with maintaining profitability. Based on past rounds, bids varied significantly, with highest bids such as 45, 10, and 52 in rounds 0, 1, and 2, respectively. A bid of 48 should be competitively high based on the observed bid ranges but still allows for a safe profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 10 for the prize and considering past bidding behaviors, a conservative bid is sensible. In round 0, bids ranged high at 45, 43, and 34, while in round 1, they were much lower at 10, 0, and 0. In rounds 2 and 3, bids were in the mid-range with 52, 38, 35 and 55, 48, 47 respectively. Since my prize value is relatively low, bidding 5 minimizes potential loss and provides a slight chance of winning if competitors also bid conservatively. This balanced approach helps protect my total profit and future bidding flexibility.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 2, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 9 for the prize and analyzing past rounds' bidding behaviors, I should bid conservatively to minimize potential loss. Previous rounds showed varying bid ranges, and with a low value, it's strategic to bid very low. A bid of 2 balances out the chance of winning with minimal loss if I don't.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 65, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my current value for the prize is 68, I want to bid at a level that gives me a good chance of winning while maintaining a profit margin. In past rounds, winning bids: 45, 10, 52, 55, 5, and 2 indicate that bids around the mid-50s have a good balance of competitiveness without overshooting. A bid of 53 should be competitively high but still well below my perceived value, ensuring a profit if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48 and based on previous rounds, bids vary. Winning bids have been significantly above or below 50. By bidding 41, I strike a balance between being competitive and maintaining a higher profit margin if I win. This should position me well against typical bids I've seen, like the 30s and 50s, without overshooting unnecessarily relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My current value for the prize is 49. Looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to hover around the mid-40s to mid-50s for higher perceived values. Given this pattern, I aim to bid 42, which should be competitive based on prior winning bids while ensuring a reasonable profit margin if I win. This bid balances the risk of losing the auction with the goal of maximizing profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 37, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 43. Reviewing the previous rounds, successful bids tend to be slightly below or above the mid-40s and sometimes in the 50s, depending on the perceived value. By bidding 37, I'm aiming to be competitive while ensuring a good profit margin if I win. This bid is balanced considering past winning bids and tends to align with the lower end of successful bids without exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing profit potential.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 63, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 67, 63. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 67. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 84, I want to place a competitive bid without overshooting and reducing my potential profit. Reviewing the past rounds, winning bids tend to fall in the 40s to mid-50s range, but with my higher perceived value, I want to bid at a higher point to ensure victory while maintaining a profit. A bid of 63 balances competitiveness and profit potential, assuming that other bids might be slightly lower but within a competitive range determined by previous rounds.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 52 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 65, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 80, and considering previous rounds where bids have varied significantly, I'll opt for a higher bid to increase my chance of winning but still aim to keep the payment reasonable relative to the expected second-highest bid. Historical data shows that bids have been aggressive when perceived values are high. By bidding 65, I balance the probability of winning and maximizing potential profit from a second-highest bid likely in the lower to mid 50s.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, I need to consider historical bidding patterns. Previously, bids have varied, but a bid of 45 seems competitive based on past data, striking a balance between winning and minimizing payment. This bid considers the likelihood of Andy and Betty's bids, aiming to win while preserving a reasonable profit margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value for the prize is 51, and considering the historical bidding patterns of Andy and Betty, it's clear that bidding aggressively doesn't always yield optimal profit. In previous rounds, bids varied from low (near 0) to relatively high (up to 65). A bid of 40, in this case, would likely position me as a competitive yet conservative bidder, aiming to win the prize while keeping the payment to the second-highest bid reasonable. My goal is to balance competitiveness with a higher likelihood of turning a profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 37, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 43 for this round and reflecting on previous rounds, I aim to balance my bid to optimize potential profit. Historical data shows variability in bids with significant instances where the highest bids were slightly above the mid-30s to mid-40s. Aiming for 33 is a strategic choice to potentially outbid others while keeping the payment to the second-highest bid reasonable, thus maximizing my profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 67, 63. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 67. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 88, I need to make a competitive bid without overpaying. Historical data shows that winning bids have typically been in the range of 44 to 68 for high perceived values. By bidding 68, I maximize my chances of winning while aiming to ensure that the second-highest bid results in a profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 55 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 54, and since I want to maximize profit, I'd like to bid lower than my value to ensure I make a profit if I win. Considering the history of previous rounds, bidding around 34 increases my chances of paying less than my perceived prize value while still having a good chance to win.'

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66, I want to bid an amount that gives me a good chance to win while maintaining a profit margin. From the previous rounds, it is evident that bids can vary significantly. In round 0, the highest bid was 45, and in round 1, the highest was 10. Therefore, a bid of 52 is strategically higher than those in previous rounds but still well below my prize value of 66, ensuring that if I win, I will likely make a profit.'

Based on past rounds, bids varied significantly, with highest bids such as 45, 10, and 52 in rounds 0, 1, and 2, respectively. A bid of 48 should be competitively high based on the observed bid ranges but still allows for a safe profit margin if I win.'

In round 0, bids ranged high at 45, 43, and 34, while in round 1, they were much lower at 10, 0, and 0. In rounds 2 and 3, bids were in the mid-range with 52, 38, 35 and 55, 48, 47 respectively. Since my prize value is relatively low, bidding 5 minimizes potential loss and provides a slight chance of winning if competitors also bid conservatively. This balanced approach helps protect my total profit and future bidding flexibility.'

Previous rounds showed varying bid ranges, and with a low value, it's strategic to bid very low. A bid of 2 balances out the chance of winning with minimal loss if I don't.'

In past rounds, winning bids: 45, 10, 52, 55, 5, and 2 indicate that bids around the mid-50s have a good balance of competitiveness without overshooting.

Looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to hover around the mid-40s to mid-50s for higher perceived values.

This bid balances the risk of losing the auction with the goal of maximizing profit.'

This bid is balanced considering past winning bids and tends to align with the lower end of successful bids without exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing profit potential.'

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit. A bid of 20 strikes a balance, making me somewhat competitive without risking a significant loss if I do not win.

In previous rounds, bids varied from low (near 0) to relatively high (up to 65). A bid of 40, in this case, would likely position me as a competitive yet conservative bidder, aiming to win the prize while keeping the payment to the second-highest bid reasonable. My goal is to balance competitiveness with a higher likelihood of turning a profit.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 54, and since I want to maximize profit, I'd like to bid lower than my value to ensure I make a profit if I win. Considering the history of previous rounds, bidding around 34 increases my chances of paying less than my perceived prize value while still having a good chance to win.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 10, 0, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 0. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my low value for the prize at 13, I will bid conservatively. My aim is to increase my chances of a profitable win if my competitors bid low, while minimizing potential loss if I don't win. A bid of 10 is close but comfortably lower than my prize value, keeping my potential loss small.'

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66, I want to bid an amount that gives me a good chance to win while maintaining a profit margin. From the previous rounds, it is evident that bids can vary significantly. In round 0, the highest bid was 45, and in round 1, the highest was 10. Therefore, a bid of 52 is strategically higher than those in previous rounds but still well below my prize value of 66, ensuring that if I win, I will likely make a profit.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 62, I aim to bid at a level that balances a high chance of winning with maintaining profitability. Based on past rounds, bids varied significantly, with highest bids such as 45, 10, and 52 in rounds 0, 1, and 2, respectively. A bid of 48 should be competitively high based on the observed bid ranges but still allows for a safe profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 10 for the prize and considering past bidding behaviors, a conservative bid is sensible. In round 0, bids ranged high at 45, 43, and 34, while in round 1, they were much lower at 10, 0, and 0. In rounds 2 and 3, bids were in the mid-range with 52, 38, 35 and 55, 48, 47 respectively. Since my prize value is relatively low, bidding 5 minimizes potential loss and provides a slight chance of winning if competitors also bid conservatively. This balanced approach helps protect my total profit and future bidding flexibility.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 2, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 9 for the prize and analyzing past rounds' bidding behaviors, I should bid conservatively to minimize potential loss. Previous rounds showed varying bid ranges, and with a low value, it's strategic to bid very low. A bid of 2 balances out the chance of winning with minimal loss if I don't.'

In past rounds, winning bids: 45, 10, 52, 55, 5, and 2 indicate that bids around the mid-50s have a good balance of competitiveness without overshooting. A bid of 53 should be competitively high but still well below my perceived value, ensuring a profit if I win.'

Winning bids have been significantly above or below 50. By bidding 41, I strike a balance between being competitive and maintaining a higher profit margin if I win. This should position me well against typical bids I've seen, like the 30s and 50s, without overshooting unnecessarily relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 40.

Looking at the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to hover around the mid-40s to mid-50s for higher perceived values. Given this pattern, I aim to bid 42, which should be competitive based on prior winning bids while ensuring a reasonable profit margin if I win. This bid balances the risk of losing the auction with the goal of maximizing profit.'

Reviewing the previous rounds, successful bids tend to be slightly below or above the mid-40s and sometimes in the 50s, depending on the perceived value. By bidding 37, I'm aiming to be competitive while ensuring a good profit margin if I win. This bid is balanced considering past winning bids and tends to align with the lower end of successful bids without exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing profit potential.'

Reviewing the past rounds, winning bids tend to fall in the 40s to mid-50s range, but with my higher perceived value, I want to bid at a higher point to ensure victory while maintaining a profit. A bid of 63 balances competitiveness and profit potential, assuming that other bids might be slightly lower but within a competitive range determined by previous rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 60, I need to consider the second-highest bid to maximize my profit. Historically, bids can vary, but aiming around 45 allows me a reasonable margin to win while preserving profit if I win with a bid close to this amount.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 10, 0, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 10 and paid 0. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is very low (10), it's highly likely that other bidders will have higher perceived values and therefore place higher bids. Bidding 0 allows me to avoid unnecessary loss since winning with this low value is improbable. It's better to save resources for future rounds.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 38, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 47 and considering the bids from previous rounds (45, 43, 34) and (10, 0, 0), it seems reasonable to bid lower than the value but high enough to have a chance of winning. Bidder patterns suggest a variability in perceived values and aggressive bidding. A bid of 35 aims to balance potential winnings with an optimal second-highest bid payment, keeping profit maximization in mind.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 48. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 71 and considering the bidding patterns of previous rounds (45, 43, 34), (10, 0, 0), and (52, 38, 35), it's clear there can be significant variability in bids. Bidding 55 represents a strategic balance where I stand a good chance to win while aiming to minimize the payment to the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 20, 10.

With my relatively low perceived value, bidding aggressively might not yield a win, and even if it does, it might not result in a profit. A bid of 20 strikes a balance, making me somewhat competitive without risking a significant loss if I do not win. By bidding conservatively, I can preserve my resources for rounds where my perceived value might be higher.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 6, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 2, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is only 6, it is very low compared to the values I've seen in previous rounds. It's highly likely that Andy and Betty will have higher perceived values and therefore place higher bids. Bidding 0 minimizes my losses and conserves resources for future rounds where my perceived value might be higher, thus maximizing my total profit in the long run.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 80, and considering previous rounds where bids have varied significantly, I'll opt for a higher bid to increase my chance of winning but still aim to keep the payment reasonable relative to the expected second-highest bid. Historical data shows that bids have been aggressive when perceived values are high. By bidding 65, I balance the probability of winning and maximizing potential profit from a second-highest bid likely in the lower to mid 50s.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, I need to consider historical bidding patterns. Previously, bids have varied, but a bid of 45 seems competitive based on past data, striking a balance between winning and minimizing payment. This bid considers the likelihood of Andy and Betty's bids, aiming to win while preserving a reasonable profit margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 44, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value for the prize is 51, and considering the historical bidding patterns of Andy and Betty, it's clear that bidding aggressively doesn't always yield optimal profit. In previous rounds, bids varied from low (near 0) to relatively high (up to 65). A bid of 40, in this case, would likely position me as a competitive yet conservative bidder, aiming to win the prize while keeping the payment to the second-highest bid reasonable. My goal is to balance competitiveness with a higher likelihood of turning a profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 37, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 43 for this round and reflecting on previous rounds, I aim to balance my bid to optimize potential profit. Historical data shows variability in bids with significant instances where the highest bids were slightly above the mid-30s to mid-40s. Aiming for 33 is a strategic choice to potentially outbid others while keeping the payment to the second-highest bid reasonable, thus maximizing my profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 67, 63. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 67. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 88, I need to make a competitive bid without overpaying. Historical data shows that winning bids have typically been in the range of 44 to 68 for high perceived values. By bidding 68, I maximize my chances of winning while aiming to ensure that the second-highest bid results in a profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 45.

Previous rounds have shown mid-range bids (around the 40s) being successful, balancing a high chance of winning with a manageable second-highest bid cost. Hence, a bid of 45 aims to maximize my profit potential.'

In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44. Bidding slightly below my perceived value, at 18, will allow me to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, the payment will likely be less than or close to the true common value, minimizing potential losses.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 and considering the historical bidding patterns, I've observed that bidding too high can result in minimal or negative profit margins. For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit.

A bid of 38 balances competitiveness and the likelihood of winning while maximizing my profit considering the historical bidding patterns from Andy and Charles.'

For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win.

Bidding slightly below my perceived value, at 18, will allow me to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, the payment will likely be less than or close to the true common value, minimizing potential losses.'

Given my current value towards the prize is 43, I want to be competitive without overpaying. A bid of 38 balances competitiveness and the likelihood of winning while maximizing my profit considering the historical bidding patterns from Andy and Charles.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 and considering the historical bidding patterns, I've observed that bidding too high can result in minimal or negative profit margins. For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win. This bid is slightly below my perceived value, allowing for potential bid variations from Andy and Charles.'

Observing the bidding history, the winning bids have generally been close to the second-highest bids. Therefore, bidding 68 should position me as a strong contender to win the prize and still generate a positive profit margin, considering the second-highest bids Andy and Charles have placed previously.'

The history suggests that other bidders bid significantly higher when their values are higher. Thus, bidding 2 allows me to avoid substantial losses, as the likelihood of winning with a bid of 2 is very slim, but it aligns with my low perceived value.'

Historical data suggests that bidders often bid below their perceived values, so a bid of 86 should position me well to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 72. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'I chose to bid 72 because my value for the prize is 85, and I want to stay competitive without overbidding. By considering possible bids from Andy and Charles, I estimate that bidding slightly lower than my perceived value helps maximize my chances of winning the prize and securing a good profit margin by paying potentially lesser than 72.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous round, the winning bid was fairly high at 79, and the second-highest was 72. Knowing my value for the prize is 61 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive but avoids overpaying. Given that the bids can vary significantly among bidders, I will bid 55 to balance competitiveness and profit potential.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48 this round, and analyzing the previous rounds, I've observed a mix of high and moderate bids. In round 0, the highest bid was 79, and in round 1, it was 62. To maximize my chances of winning without overpaying, I should bid slightly below my value. By bidding 44, I stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, my profit margin is optimized considering the second-highest bids observed previously.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the perceived value of the prize is 19, I want to bid conservatively to ensure that I do not overpay if I win. In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44. Bidding slightly below my perceived value, at 18, will allow me to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, the payment will likely be less than or close to the true common value, minimizing potential losses.'

Given my current value towards the prize is 43, I want to be competitive without overpaying. A bid of 38 balances competitiveness and the likelihood of winning while maximizing my profit considering the historical bidding patterns from Andy and Charles.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 and considering the historical bidding patterns, I've observed that bidding too high can result in minimal or negative profit margins. For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win. This bid is slightly below my perceived value, allowing for potential bid variations from Andy and Charles.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 86, 79, 68. The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 74, I want to bid competitively while ensuring I have a good profit margin. Observing the bidding history, the winning bids have generally been close to the second-highest bids. Therefore, bidding 68 should position me as a strong contender to win the prize and still generate a positive profit margin, considering the second-highest bids Andy and Charles have placed previously.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 12, 1.

My current value is 14, which is quite low. To maximize my profit while staying competitive, I will bid slightly below my value at 12 in hopes that the winning bid exceeds mine but doesn't result in me winning with a significant overpayment.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'I chose to bid 72 because my value for the prize is 85, and I want to stay competitive without overbidding. By considering possible bids from Andy and Charles, I estimate that bidding slightly lower than my perceived value helps maximize my chances of winning the prize and securing a good profit margin by paying potentially lesser than 72.'

Knowing my value for the prize is 61 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive but avoids overpaying. Given that the bids can vary significantly among bidders, I will bid 55 to balance competitiveness and profit potential.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48 this round, and analyzing the previous rounds, I've observed a mix of high and moderate bids. In round 0, the highest bid was 79, and in round 1, it was 62. To maximize my chances of winning without overpaying, I should bid slightly below my value. By bidding 44, I stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, my profit margin is optimized considering the second-highest bids observed previously.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the perceived value of the prize is 19, I want to bid conservatively to ensure that I do not overpay if I win. In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44. Bidding slightly below my perceived value, at 18, will allow me to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, the payment will likely be less than or close to the true common value, minimizing potential losses.'

Given my current value towards the prize is 43, I want to be competitive without overpaying. A bid of 38 balances competitiveness and the likelihood of winning while maximizing my profit considering the historical bidding patterns from Andy and Charles.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38 and considering the historical bidding patterns, I've observed that bidding too high can result in minimal or negative profit margins. For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win. This bid is slightly below my perceived value, allowing for potential bid variations from Andy and Charles.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 74, I want to bid competitively while ensuring I have a good profit margin. Observing the bidding history, the winning bids have generally been close to the second-highest bids. Therefore, bidding 68 should position me as a strong contender to win the prize and still generate a positive profit margin, considering the second-highest bids Andy and Charles have placed previously.'

My current value is 14, which is quite low. To maximize my profit while staying competitive, I will bid slightly below my value at 12 in hopes that the winning bid exceeds mine but doesn't result in me winning with a significant overpayment.'

Bidding 52 allows me to be competitive without overbidding significantly and risking a negative profit margin. This bid is optimized based on past rounds' outcomes, balancing the chance to win the prize with minimizing potential overpayment.'

Analyzing the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids fluctuate significantly but often remain slightly below the perceived values of other bidders.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 72. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is the maximum possible value of 79, and to maximize my chances of winning while still earning a profit, I will bid 79. This strategy ensures I win the prize if both competitors bid below 79. Since the payment is only the second-highest bid, bidding my full value minimizes risk and maximizes my profit.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history, the perceived values and bids of other bidders seem to range significantly. Since my value towards the prize is 63, bidding just slightly below my perceived value at 62 minimizes the risk of overbidding while still having a strong chance to win the auction. My goal is to win and maximize profit by paying a minimal amount, and bidding slightly below my value achieves this.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 44, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'The history of previous rounds shows that the bids of other bidders range significantly. Given my value towards the prize is 59, I will bid 54 to balance the risk of overbidding with the chances of winning while maximizing profit. Bidding slightly below my perceived value has been a strategy used before to avoid overpayment.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 2, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 5, it is crucial to place a bid that minimizes the risk of making a loss while still having a slim chance to win if other bids are extremely low. The history suggests that other bidders bid significantly higher when their values are higher. Thus, bidding 2 allows me to avoid substantial losses, as the likelihood of winning with a bid of 2 is very slim, but it aligns with my low perceived value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, other bidders have tended to bid significantly lower amounts than their values. My value towards the prize is 39, and I want to maximize my total profit. Placing a bid of 35 gives me a strong chance to win while still bidding below my value to avoid overpayment. This strategy aims to balance winning the auction with the potential of maximizing profit by not exceeding the expected payments.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 34, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, where other bidders' values and bids have shown a variety of strategies and amounts, I aim to place a bid that maximizes my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpayment. My perceived value for this round is 42. Bidding 38 provides a solid chance to win without exceeding my perceived value substantially, thus balancing the need to be competitive with the objective of maximizing profit.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 91, you bid 86, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 86, 79, 68. The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 91, bidding slightly below this amount at 86 ensures I have a high chance of winning while mitigating the risk of overpaying based on the likely bids of other bidders. Historical data suggests that bidders often bid below their perceived values, so a bid of 86 should position me well to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 6, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 12, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds and my value of 6 for this prize, it is wise to minimize the risk of overbidding with such a low value. Bidding 1 gives me protection from significant losses while retaining a small chance of winning if the others bid very low amounts. This strategy aims to keep my potential losses minimal while acknowledging the low value I have for this prize.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 52, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 61 and based on the previous bidding behaviors of other bidders, I should bid slightly below my value to maximize profit while maintaining a strong chance of winning. From past rounds, I observe that bidding approximately 4 to 5 units below my perceived value has often resulted in competitive bids without excessive overpayment. Thus, I will bid 57 to balance winning the auction with potential profit maximization.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 47, 45.

Thus, bidding 47 balances the chance of winning with profit maximization.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 66, 65, 61. The highest bidder won with a bid of 66 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 66 and based on the previous bidding behaviors and outcomes, I typically bid slightly below my perceived value. A bid of 61 should balance the chance of winning the prize while minimizing overpayment, which helps maximize my total profit.

In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44.

In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 53, I should bid below this value to avoid overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids have been relatively high compared to the perceived values, but I have yet to win a round. Therefore, I need to balance competitiveness without risking too much. Based on the history, a bid of 41 seems reasonable to maximize my profit and still stand a chance to win.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 34, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 36 for the prize, I want to bid below this to avoid overpaying if I win. Based on the history, winning bids typically range higher than perceived values but not excessively. Therefore, I will bid 28 to balance competitiveness and the risk of overpayment, aiming to maximize my profit while still having a reasonable chance to win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 89, you bid 79, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 86, 79, 68. The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 89 for the prize and the past bidding patterns, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while staying profitable. The highest bids from previous rounds (79, 62, 54, 18, 41, 38) suggest I need to bid near the top to win. I will bid 79 to win the auction and ensure I don't pay more than my perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 12, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 12, I should bid much lower to avoid overpaying in a highly competitive environment. History shows winning bids range quite high above perceived values, often leading to a low or negative profit for the winner. Bidding 5 balances the low perceived value while staying competitive enough to possibly win if the others bid similarly low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 52, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48, I want to bid below my value to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. From the history, it appears that winning bids that are a bit lower have still been competitive. Bidding 38 seems like a good balance, offering a chance to win without excessive risk of overpayment.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 64 and based on previous rounds where winning bids are competitive but often higher than perceived values, I want to bid below my value to avoid overpaying. However, to still have a chance at winning, I will bid 54, which balances competitiveness and leaves room for a reasonable profit if I win while minimizing the risk of loss if I lose.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 66, 65, 61. The highest bidder won with a bid of 66 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 76 for the prize, I want to bid below this value to avoid the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds have shown winning bids often exceed the perceived values, but bidding too high tends to result in low or negative profits. A bid of 65 balances competitiveness, maximizes the chance to win without excessive risk, and aims to outbid others who might underbid.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 82 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 72. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is the maximum possible value of 79, and to maximize my chances of winning while still earning a profit, I will bid 79. This strategy ensures I win the prize if both competitors bid below 79. Since the payment is only the second-highest bid, bidding my full value minimizes risk and maximizes my profit.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 55, 36.

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history, the perceived values and bids of other bidders seem to range significantly. Since my value towards the prize is 63, bidding just slightly below my perceived value at 62 minimizes the risk of overbidding while still having a strong chance to win the auction. My goal is to win and maximize profit by paying a minimal amount, and bidding slightly below my value achieves this.'

Given my value towards the prize is 59, I will bid 54 to balance the risk of overbidding with the chances of winning while maximizing profit. Bidding slightly below my perceived value has been a strategy used before to avoid overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 5, it is crucial to place a bid that minimizes the risk of making a loss while still having a slim chance to win if other bids are extremely low. The history suggests that other bidders bid significantly higher when their values are higher. Thus, bidding 2 allows me to avoid substantial losses, as the likelihood of winning with a bid of 2 is very slim, but it aligns with my low perceived value.'

My value towards the prize is 39, and I want to maximize my total profit. Placing a bid of 35 gives me a strong chance to win while still bidding below my value to avoid overpayment. This strategy aims to balance winning the auction with the potential of maximizing profit by not exceeding the expected payments.'

My perceived value for this round is 42. Bidding 38 provides a solid chance to win without exceeding my perceived value substantially, thus balancing the need to be competitive with the objective of maximizing profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 91, bidding slightly below this amount at 86 ensures I have a high chance of winning while mitigating the risk of overpaying based on the likely bids of other bidders. Historical data suggests that bidders often bid below their perceived values, so a bid of 86 should position me well to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds and my value of 6 for this prize, it is wise to minimize the risk of overbidding with such a low value. Bidding 1 gives me protection from significant losses while retaining a small chance of winning if the others bid very low amounts. This strategy aims to keep my potential losses minimal while acknowledging the low value I have for this prize.'

From past rounds, I observe that bidding approximately 4 to 5 units below my perceived value has often resulted in competitive bids without excessive overpayment. Thus, I will bid 57 to balance winning the auction with potential profit maximization.'

A bid of 61 should balance the chance of winning the prize while minimizing overpayment, which helps maximize my total profit. Past rounds show that this strategy often positions me competitively without excessive overbidding.'

In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44.

For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win.

Bidding 52 allows me to be competitive without overbidding significantly and risking a negative profit margin. This bid is optimized based on past rounds' outcomes, balancing the chance to win the prize with minimizing potential overpayment.'

Analyzing the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids fluctuate significantly but often remain slightly below the perceived values of other bidders. By bidding 45, I aim to stay competitive without overpaying, based on the observed bid patterns and outcomes. This strategy will ideally result in securing the prize at a reasonable cost, optimizing total profit potential.'

To maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overbid and risk a loss, bidding 66 should position me competitively. It\u2019s slightly below my perceived value, balancing the profit margin with the competitiveness needed based on the historical bids observed.'

The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 5, it is crucial to place a bid that minimizes the risk of making a loss while still having a slim chance to win if other bids are extremely low. The history suggests that other bidders bid significantly higher when their values are higher. Thus, bidding 2 allows me to avoid substantial losses, as the likelihood of winning with a bid of 2 is very slim, but it aligns with my low perceived value.'

My perceived value for this round is 42. Bidding 38 provides a solid chance to win without exceeding my perceived value substantially, thus balancing the need to be competitive with the objective of maximizing profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 86 and paid 79. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 91, bidding slightly below this amount at 86 ensures I have a high chance of winning while mitigating the risk of overpaying based on the likely bids of other bidders. Historical data suggests that bidders often bid below their perceived values, so a bid of 86 should position me well to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds and my value of 6 for this prize, it is wise to minimize the risk of overbidding with such a low value. Bidding 1 gives me protection from significant losses while retaining a small chance of winning if the others bid very low amounts. This strategy aims to keep my potential losses minimal while acknowledging the low value I have for this prize.'

From past rounds, I observe that bidding approximately 4 to 5 units below my perceived value has often resulted in competitive bids without excessive overpayment. Thus, I will bid 57 to balance winning the auction with potential profit maximization.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 79, and in round 1, it was 62. To maximize my chances of winning without overpaying, I should bid slightly below my value.

In the previous rounds, the second-highest bids were 72, 55, and 44. Bidding slightly below my perceived value, at 18, will allow me to stay competitive while ensuring that if I win, the payment will likely be less than or close to the true common value, minimizing potential losses.'

For example, in round 3, a bid of 18 led to a loss when the true value was low, while in round 4, a bid of 38 was very close to the second highest bid and resulted in no profit. By bidding 34, I aim to be competitive while leaving enough room to ensure a positive profit margin if I win.

Analyzing the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids fluctuate significantly but often remain slightly below the perceived values of other bidders. By bidding 45, I aim to stay competitive without overpaying, based on the observed bid patterns and outcomes. This strategy will ideally result in securing the prize at a reasonable cost, optimizing total profit potential.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 72. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is the maximum possible value of 79, and to maximize my chances of winning while still earning a profit, I will bid 79. This strategy ensures I win the prize if both competitors bid below 79. Since the payment is only the second-highest bid, bidding my full value minimizes risk and maximizes my profit.'

Since my value towards the prize is 63, bidding just slightly below my perceived value at 62 minimizes the risk of overbidding while still having a strong chance to win the auction. My goal is to win and maximize profit by paying a minimal amount, and bidding slightly below my value achieves this.'

Given my value towards the prize is 59, I will bid 54 to balance the risk of overbidding with the chances of winning while maximizing profit. Bidding slightly below my perceived value has been a strategy used before to avoid overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 2 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 5, it is crucial to place a bid that minimizes the risk of making a loss while still having a slim chance to win if other bids are extremely low. The history suggests that other bidders bid significantly higher when their values are higher. Thus, bidding 2 allows me to avoid substantial losses, as the likelihood of winning with a bid of 2 is very slim, but it aligns with my low perceived value.'

My value towards the prize is 39, and I want to maximize my total profit. Placing a bid of 35 gives me a strong chance to win while still bidding below my value to avoid overpayment. This strategy aims to balance winning the auction with the potential of maximizing profit by not exceeding the expected payments.'

Bidding 38 provides a solid chance to win without exceeding my perceived value substantially, thus balancing the need to be competitive with the objective of maximizing profit.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 91, bidding slightly below this amount at 86 ensures I have a high chance of winning while mitigating the risk of overpaying based on the likely bids of other bidders. Historical data suggests that bidders often bid below their perceived values, so a bid of 86 should position me well to win without excessively surpassing the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds and my value of 6 for this prize, it is wise to minimize the risk of overbidding with such a low value. Bidding 1 gives me protection from significant losses while retaining a small chance of winning if the others bid very low amounts. This strategy aims to keep my potential losses minimal while acknowledging the low value I have for this prize.'

A bid of 61 should balance the chance of winning the prize while minimizing overpayment, which helps maximize my total profit. Past rounds show that this strategy often positions me competitively without excessive overbidding.'

I aim to place a bid that maximizes my chances of winning while leaving a margin to avoid overpayment in case of highly competitive bids. By bidding 80, I offer a strong bid likely to outrank others while staying below my value to maintain potential profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 28, 15.

When my perceived value was 31, the typical strategy that balanced winning and profitability was to bid around 3-4 units below my perceived value.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of the prize is 19 this round and evaluating the history of previous rounds, I have observed that too high or too competitive bidding has often resulted in minimal or negative profits, especially when the true common value turned out to be lower. To balance competitiveness and profitability, I will bid below my perceived value. A bid of 15 ensures that I am conservative enough to avoid overpaying while staying somewhat competitive based on previous rounds\u2019 second-highest bids.'

In previous rounds, winning bids were typically quite high, but I need to be cautious and aim to submit a competitive bid without risking a loss.

In previous rounds, the winning bids have been relatively high compared to the perceived values, but I have yet to win a round. Therefore, I need to balance competitiveness without risking too much.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 89 for the prize and the past bidding patterns, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while staying profitable. The highest bids from previous rounds (79, 62, 54, 18, 41, 38) suggest I need to bid near the top to win. I will bid 79 to win the auction and ensure I don't pay more than my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 12, I should bid much lower to avoid overpaying in a highly competitive environment. History shows winning bids range quite high above perceived values, often leading to a low or negative profit for the winner. Bidding 5 balances the low perceived value while staying competitive enough to possibly win if the others bid similarly low.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 52, 38.

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48, I want to bid below my value to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. From the history, it appears that winning bids that are a bit lower have still been competitive. Bidding 38 seems like a good balance, offering a chance to win without excessive risk of overpayment.'

However, to still have a chance at winning, I will bid 54, which balances competitiveness and leaves room for a reasonable profit if I win while minimizing the risk of loss if I lose.'

The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 76 for the prize, I want to bid below this value to avoid the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds have shown winning bids often exceed the perceived values, but bidding too high tends to result in low or negative profits. A bid of 65 balances competitiveness, maximizes the chance to win without excessive risk, and aims to outbid others who might underbid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 80, 72.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I want to bid below this value to avoid overpaying. Reviewing the history, winning bids typically range a bit higher than perceived values but not excessively. Bidding 72 balances competitiveness and allows room for a reasonable profit if I win, while minimizing the risk of a significant loss if I lose.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 28, 15.

Previous rounds show that bids often range significantly higher than the perceived value, leading to potential losses. To maximize my profit while minimizing risk, a bid of 7 seems prudent, providing a competitive edge without significant risk of loss if others bid higher.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 81 for the prize, and based on previous rounds where Andy and Charles have bid between 40-55 when their values were lower than mine, I will place a bid that is high enough to win but still ensures a significant profit. A bid of 72 strategically positions me to win with a high probability while optimizing my profit margin above the likely second-highest bid from Andy or Charles.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 80. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 86 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous bidding patterns from Andy and Charles, who have consistently bid between 48 and 65, I would choose to bid 80. This is strategically high enough to increase my likelihood of winning while ensuring I still make a profit if the second-highest bid remains typical of their past behavior.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 37, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 43 for the prize and analyzing previous rounds where Andy and Charles have consistently bid between 40 and 65, I will place a bid that is still competitive but reflects a lower perceived value for the prize. Estimating my competition's bids might still be in that range, a bid of 37 strategically positions me to potentially win with a reasonable margin while ensuring the second-highest bid isn't too burdensome, maximizing my total profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for the prize in this round and considering the bidding patterns of Andy and Charles in previous rounds (their bids often range between 35 and 65), I will place a bid that maximizes my likelihood of winning while ensuring a significant profit. A bid of 70 is strategically high enough to outbid their usual range but still allows me to make a profit assuming the second-highest bid falls within the expected pattern.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round and analyzing previous rounds where Andy and Charles' bids have ranged between 35 and 75, I would place a lower bid to avoid overbidding. A bid of 20 balances the risk and reward, as it's below my perceived value, ensuring I don't lose profit even if I don't win this round.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize in this round, I aim to maximize my profit while still making a competitive bid. From the historical data of previous rounds, I observe that Andy and Charles have bid in the range of 35-65 when their perceived values vary. Given that, I will place a bid of 60, which strategically positions me to win the auction with a high probability but ensures I don't overbid too much relative to my perceived value.'

From previous rounds, if I observe that their bids are typically around 45-55 when their values are between 50 and 70, a bid of 50 strategically positions me to win with a high likelihood, leading to a significant profit over the second-highest bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 55, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 for the prize this round and taking into account the previous rounds where bids from Andy and Charles were around 40-50 when their values were lower, I would estimate that they might bid in a similar range this time. Placing a bid of 68 strategically increases my chances of winning while ensuring a significant profit margin, as it is likely above the second-highest bid but still less than my perceived value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 81 for the prize, and based on previous rounds where Andy and Charles have bid between 40-55 when their values were lower than mine, I will place a bid that is high enough to win but still ensures a significant profit. A bid of 72 strategically positions me to win with a high probability while optimizing my profit margin above the likely second-highest bid from Andy or Charles.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 79, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 80, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 80. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 86 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous bidding patterns from Andy and Charles, who have consistently bid between 48 and 65, I would choose to bid 80. This is strategically high enough to increase my likelihood of winning while ensuring I still make a profit if the second-highest bid remains typical of their past behavior.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 37, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 43 for the prize and analyzing previous rounds where Andy and Charles have consistently bid between 40 and 65, I will place a bid that is still competitive but reflects a lower perceived value for the prize. Estimating my competition's bids might still be in that range, a bid of 37 strategically positions me to potentially win with a reasonable margin while ensuring the second-highest bid isn't too burdensome, maximizing my total profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60.

A bid of 70 is strategically high enough to outbid their usual range but still allows me to make a profit assuming the second-highest bid falls within the expected pattern.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round and analyzing previous rounds where Andy and Charles' bids have ranged between 35 and 75, I would place a lower bid to avoid overbidding. A bid of 20 balances the risk and reward, as it's below my perceived value, ensuring I don't lose profit even if I don't win this round.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize in this round, I aim to maximize my profit while still making a competitive bid. From the historical data of previous rounds, I observe that Andy and Charles have bid in the range of 35-65 when their perceived values vary. Given that, I will place a bid of 60, which strategically positions me to win the auction with a high probability but ensures I don't overbid too much relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 40, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize in this round, my objective is to maximize my profit while strategically bidding low enough to account for the possibility that Andy and Charles have lower or similar values. Based on the historical pattern, their bids typically range from 35 to 65 when their values vary. A bid of 40 will likely position me as competitive while not overshooting, ensuring that I do not incur a significant loss if I win with this bid and pay the second-highest amount.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 18, 18.

To maximize my total profit, I need to bid conservatively to avoid winning with a bid that negates my profit.

The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I aim to bid conservatively below my perceived value to balance the likelihood of winning while minimizing the cost based on the second-highest bid. Considering that in the previous round, the highest bid was 50, and my perceived value is 67, a bid of 55 should be competitive enough while providing some margin for profit.'

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the highest winning bid was 68, with the second-highest bids typically in the mid-50s range. Given my current perceived value of 76, bidding 65 should make me competitive for winning the prize while allowing for a potential profit if the second-highest bid remains close to previous patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 80. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history from the previous rounds, the highest winning bid has ranged from 50 to 72, with my perceived value currently being 84. To maximize my profit, I need to bid competitively while ensuring I have a good buffer for profitability. By bidding 70, I position myself as a strong contender for winning the prize, while also expecting that the second-highest bid will be sufficiently lower to ensure I make a profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 37, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, bidding slightly lower than my perceived value might be advantageous. In previous rounds, the highest bids have varied significantly, but typically, the second-highest bids have ranged from 40 to 65. Given my current perceived value of 40, I choose to bid 35 as it may increase my chances of winning, assuming others might bid closer to their higher perceived values. This strategy allows me to potentially secure the prize while minimizing the cost relative to the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 91, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 91, I aim to bid competitively while ensuring a buffer for profitability based on historical data. Previous rounds have shown bids ranging from 35 to 80. By bidding 75, I position myself as a strong contender for winning the prize and expect the second-highest bid to be sufficiently lower to ensure a good profit.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical bid patterns where the second-highest bids have ranged between the mid-30s to mid-60s, and the highest bids typically being above that range, I choose to bid slightly lower than my perceived value of 32. By bidding 28, I aim to minimize potential losses while still maintaining a competitive edge. Given previous trends, this bid might allow me to win the prize at a lower cost if others' bids fall within or slightly above their perceived values.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical bidding patterns, with second-highest bids often falling in the mid-50s to low-60s range and to maintain competitiveness without exceeding my perceived value, I will bid 55. This allows for a better chance of winning while maintaining a potential profit margin if the second highest bid remains in the expected range.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 40, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the historical bid patterns, the highest bids typically range from mid-60s to low-80s, while second-highest bids cluster around mid-50s to high-60s. With my perceived value being 45, slightly underbidding at 40 can help me stay competitive and potentially secure the prize if others bid close to their perceived values. This strategy balances the likelihood of winning with a buffer for profitability.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 18, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 21, I want to bid slightly lower to stay competitive, maximize my chances of winning, and minimize potential losses. Previous rounds have shown that the second-highest bids range from 20 to 70. Bidding 18 aligns with being aggressive enough to win while protecting against excessive costs due to the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 28, I want to bid conservatively to maximize total profit. Bidders Andy and Betty generally bid close to their perceived values but slightly below. A bid of 20 is significantly below my perceived value of 28, but still has potential to outbid the others if they have lower perceived values this round, as they often bid conservatively as well.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical patterns, Andy and Betty generally bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Given my value of 49 for this round, bidding 38 should strategically position me to outbid them if their values are somewhat lower, without overbidding significantly.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical trends, Andy and Betty tend to bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Considering my value for this round is 45, I will bid 32. This bid is sufficiently below my perceived value to avoid overpaying, while still being competitive enough to outbid Andy or Betty if their values are significantly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -14.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 18, 18.

Based on historical trends, bidders Andy and Betty generally bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Since my value is one of the lower ones we've had, I choose to risk a lower bid at 18, which is below my perceived value but potentially high enough to still be competitive if Andy and Betty have similarly low values.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 89, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 72, 66.

Based on historical patterns, Andy and Betty tend to bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Typical high bids range close to their perceived values but tend to be less than their maximum. A bid of 72 should be high enough to compete strongly but still leave room for profit, considering previous second-highest bids have often fallen in the 40s to 60s.

From previous rounds, if I observe that their bids are typically around 45-55 when their values are between 50 and 70, a bid of 50 strategically positions me to win with a high likelihood, leading to a significant profit over the second-highest bid.'

Placing a bid of 68 strategically increases my chances of winning while ensuring a significant profit margin, as it is likely above the second-highest bid but still less than my perceived value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 65, 60.

From the historical data of previous rounds, I observe that Andy and Charles have bid in the range of 35-65 when their perceived values vary.

Based on the historical pattern, their bids typically range from 35 to 65 when their values vary. A bid of 40 will likely position me as competitive while not overshooting, ensuring that I do not incur a significant loss if I win with this bid and pay the second-highest amount.'

To maximize my total profit, I need to bid conservatively to avoid winning with a bid that negates my profit. A bid of 7 reflects this careful approach, allowing me to stay in the game without risking a significant loss.'

Previous rounds showed highest winning bids ranging from the high-60s to low-70s, with second-highest bids typically from mid-50s to low-60s. Thus, a bid of 45 should keep me competitive while providing a buffer for potential profit.'

With my perceived value of 59, bidding 50 should make me competitive and usually sufficient to win if other bids are in the expected range. This strategy balances the likelihood of winning with minimizing the cost relative to the second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my potential profit.'

Based on historical trends, bidders Andy and Betty generally bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Since my value is one of the lower ones we've had, I choose to risk a lower bid at 18, which is below my perceived value but potentially high enough to still be competitive if Andy and Betty have similarly low values.'

Based on historical patterns, Andy and Betty tend to bid close to their perceived values but slightly below them. Typical high bids range close to their perceived values but tend to be less than their maximum. A bid of 72 should be high enough to compete strongly but still leave room for profit, considering previous second-highest bids have often fallen in the 40s to 60s.

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable.

In the previous rounds, bids ranged between 14 and 70, with reasonable competitors willing to bid high. To maximize my profit while still having a chance to win, I will bid 19.

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.

In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74.

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.'

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 48', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 24, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 24. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, I need to bid an amount that balances a high chance of winning the bid with ensuring a positive profit margin. Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 81, I want to make sure I have a high chance of winning without sacrificing too much of my profit. Based on previous rounds' bids, I need to bid competitively high. A bid of 70 provides a balanced mix of being competitive and ensuring a decent profit margin if I win, assuming other bidders also value the prize highly and bid close to their valuations.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 69, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my value for the prize is 69. Based on the history, bids tend to be aggressive and sometimes match high perceived values closely. To maximize my profit while increasing my chances of winning, I will bid my exact value since it matches a previous high winning bid and should be competitive enough.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 26, I need to ensure my bid is competitive but also profitable. In the previous rounds, bids ranged between 14 and 70, with reasonable competitors willing to bid high. To maximize my profit while still having a chance to win, I will bid 19. This ensures that if other bids are around their perceived values, I have a chance to win without drastically reducing my profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 38, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60, I will make a competitive bid of 55. From the previous rounds, I know bids can vary widely, but often close to the perceived value. My objective is to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable potential profit margin. By bidding 55, I strike a balance between being competitive and maximizing my profit based on the history of bidding behavior.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 6, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 6, bidding high would likely result in a loss if I win, considering previous rounds show aggressive bidding from competitors. I aim to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding, thereby maximizing long-term profits. A bid of 5 ensures I have a slim chance to win without risking too much.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, and analyzing the previous rounds where winning bids are often slightly below or equal to perceived values, I aim to bid competitively but within a range to still ensure a positive margin if I win. Therefore, I choose to bid 35, which is high enough to be competitive yet leaves potential for a decent profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 48 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 44, I want to ensure that I make a profit if I win. Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy accounts for the usual bid patterns observed in previous rounds, aiming to avoid overbidding.'

Based on the observed bid patterns, with a highest bid of 30 and a second-highest of 24 in the previous round, I estimate a bid of 70 has a good chance of being the highest bid without overbidding.'

In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.'

From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.'

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.'

Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.'

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values.

Based on previous rounds' bids, I need to bid competitively high. A bid of 70 provides a balanced mix of being competitive and ensuring a decent profit margin if I win, assuming other bidders also value the prize highly and bid close to their valuations.'

In the previous rounds, bids ranged between 14 and 70, with reasonable competitors willing to bid high. To maximize my profit while still having a chance to win, I will bid 19. This ensures that if other bids are around their perceived values, I have a chance to win without drastically reducing my profit.'

I aim to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding, thereby maximizing long-term profits. A bid of 5 ensures I have a slim chance to win without risking too much.'

Therefore, I choose to bid 35, which is high enough to be competitive yet leaves potential for a decent profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy accounts for the usual bid patterns observed in previous rounds, aiming to avoid overbidding.'

Based on the observed bid patterns, with a highest bid of 30 and a second-highest of 24 in the previous round, I estimate a bid of 70 has a good chance of being the highest bid without overbidding.'

In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.'

From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.'

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.'

Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.'

Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive.

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.

In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.'

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.'

Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.'

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.'

Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive. This strategy aims to maximize the difference between my value and the payment required, hopefully lower than my bid.'

In previous rounds, low values were bid conservatively. For instance, in round 5, I bid 2 when my value was 5, which resulted in no gain or loss.

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 24. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 28, I want to balance winning the auction and maximizing profit. From previous rounds, if the second-highest bid tends to be around half my valuation, I can bid 14 to try to outbid others while keeping enough margin to ensure profit.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 86, bidding around half my valuation appears prudent to balance between winning the auction and maximising profit. From the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bid tends to be around half to two-thirds of the highest bid, making a bid of 43 a strategic choice.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history, bidding around half to two-thirds of my valuation has been a sound strategy. Given my value towards the prize is 55, I will bid 28 to try to outbid others while maximizing my potential profit, considering the second-highest bid's pattern in previous rounds.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history, I have observed that bidding around half to two-thirds of my perceived value allows a balance between winning the auction and maximizing profit. Given my value towards the prize is 38, I will bid 19. This strategy has consistently shown a pattern where the second-highest bid tends to be around this range, enabling me to outbid others while still ensuring a margin for profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 38, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, bidding around half of my perceived value has generally been a prudent strategy. Given my value towards the prize is 50, a bid of 25 balances the likelihood of winning the auction while leaving sufficient margin to ensure a profit if I win.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 9, I have observed in previous rounds that bidding around half to one-third of my value can help balance the likelihood of winning while ensuring a margin for profit. In this case, a bid of 4 leverages this strategy to minimize the risk of overbidding and maximizes my potential profit, even if the second-highest bid is low.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value is 27, and based on past rounds, bidding approximately half of my perceived value tends to balance the chances of winning and maximizing profit while keeping the bid competitive. Therefore, I will bid 13.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'From analyzing the outcomes of previous rounds, a prudent strategy has been bidding approximately half of my perceived value. This approach balances out the chances of securing the prize and maximizing profit. Given my value towards the prize is 66, a bid of 33 follows this strategy.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 72, a strategy based on historical patterns suggests bidding around half of my perceived value. This approach balances the likelihood of winning the auction while leaving a sufficient margin to ensure a profit if I do win.'

In the previous rounds, bids ranged between 14 and 70, with reasonable competitors willing to bid high. To maximize my profit while still having a chance to win, I will bid 19. This ensures that if other bids are around their perceived values, I have a chance to win without drastically reducing my profit.'

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.

In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74.

From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.'

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.'

Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 72, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but still leaving room for a significant profit. Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive. This strategy aims to maximize the difference between my value and the payment required, hopefully lower than my bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 2, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9, I need to bid conservatively to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of loss. In previous rounds, low values were bid conservatively. For instance, in round 5, I bid 2 when my value was 5, which resulted in no gain or loss. Given the low value of 9 for this prize, a low bid will follow a similar strategy to avoid overbidding and risking a net loss. Thus, bidding 2 balances the possible win with minimal loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 44, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 59, I want to bid an amount that provides a good chance of winning while leaving room for a significant profit. In previous rounds, bid patterns showed that higher perceived values often had winning bids in the mid-to-high ranges. For example, in round 8, a perceived value of 72 had bids of 60, 55, and 36, with 60 winning. For a perceived value like 59, bidding 44 positions me competitively, considering that second-highest bids have often been lower and should allow for a decent profit margin if I win.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 24. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 44, I want to ensure that I make a profit if I win. Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy accounts for the usual bid patterns observed in previous rounds, aiming to avoid overbidding.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 87, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but still leaving room for a significant profit. Based on the observed bid patterns, with a highest bid of 30 and a second-highest of 24 in the previous round, I estimate a bid of 70 has a good chance of being the highest bid without overbidding.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, I want to find a balance between winning the auction and ensuring a profit. In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 24, I want to ensure that I make a profit if I win, while strategically aiming to bid lower to maximize profit. From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 38, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 49, and considering previous rounds, a bid in the mid-30s seems optimal. In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 5, I need to bid very conservatively to avoid the risk of a loss. Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 72, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but still leaving room for a significant profit. Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive. This strategy aims to maximize the difference between my value and the payment required, hopefully lower than my bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 2, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9, I need to bid conservatively to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of loss. In previous rounds, low values were bid conservatively. For instance, in round 5, I bid 2 when my value was 5, which resulted in no gain or loss. Given the low value of 9 for this prize, a low bid will follow a similar strategy to avoid overbidding and risking a net loss. Thus, bidding 2 balances the possible win with minimal loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 44, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 59, I want to bid an amount that provides a good chance of winning while leaving room for a significant profit. In previous rounds, bid patterns showed that higher perceived values often had winning bids in the mid-to-high ranges. For example, in round 8, a perceived value of 72 had bids of 60, 55, and 36, with 60 winning. For a perceived value like 59, bidding 44 positions me competitively, considering that second-highest bids have often been lower and should allow for a decent profit margin if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 26, the (true) common value of the prize was 31, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 26, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 26. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 34, I need to balance the need to win the auction with ensuring a profit. In previous rounds, I have observed that bidding moderately within the range of 25-45 allows for a good chance to win without overbidding, particularly when the perceived value is in a similar range. For instance, in round 6, bidding 25 aimed to straddle this balance, though it was slightly low. Based on the trends, a bid of 26 aims to optimize for winning chances while balancing the profit margin if the second-highest bid remains around typical middle values.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 28 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

I aim to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding, thereby maximizing long-term profits. A bid of 5 ensures I have a slim chance to win without risking too much.'

Therefore, I choose to bid 35, which is high enough to be competitive yet leaves potential for a decent profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

I notice that high bids typically win, but paying close to the second-highest bid is crucial to maintain profit. Bidding 41 strikes a balance\u2014it is competitive without being too close to my perceived value, allowing room for a substantial profit if I win and the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids that are slightly below perceived values tend to be effective. A bid of 60 balances being competitive while leaving room for a positive profit margin assuming the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

A bid of 2 ensures that if I win (considering the others bid very low), I will still make a slight profit. This approach aligns with my goal of maximizing long-term profit while minimizing risk.'

Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.

In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.'

From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.'

In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4.

Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13.

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.'

Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive. This strategy aims to maximize the difference between my value and the payment required, hopefully lower than my bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 2, 2.

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9, I need to bid conservatively to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of loss. In previous rounds, low values were bid conservatively. For instance, in round 5, I bid 2 when my value was 5, which resulted in no gain or loss. Given the low value of 9 for this prize, a low bid will follow a similar strategy to avoid overbidding and risking a net loss. Thus, bidding 2 balances the possible win with minimal loss.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 59, I want to bid an amount that provides a good chance of winning while leaving room for a significant profit. In previous rounds, bid patterns showed that higher perceived values often had winning bids in the mid-to-high ranges. For example, in round 8, a perceived value of 72 had bids of 60, 55, and 36, with 60 winning. For a perceived value like 59, bidding 44 positions me competitively, considering that second-highest bids have often been lower and should allow for a decent profit margin if I win.'

In previous rounds, I have observed that bidding moderately within the range of 25-45 allows for a good chance to win without overbidding, particularly when the perceived value is in a similar range. For instance, in round 6, bidding 25 aimed to straddle this balance, though it was slightly low. Based on the trends, a bid of 26 aims to optimize for winning chances while balancing the profit margin if the second-highest bid remains around typical middle values.'

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 86', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 24, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 24. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 44, I want to ensure that I make a profit if I win. Bidding 30 provides a balance; it is high enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy accounts for the usual bid patterns observed in previous rounds, aiming to avoid overbidding.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 87, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but still leaving room for a significant profit. Based on the observed bid patterns, with a highest bid of 30 and a second-highest of 24 in the previous round, I estimate a bid of 70 has a good chance of being the highest bid without overbidding.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, I want to find a balance between winning the auction and ensuring a profit. In the previous rounds, the bids showed a range where higher values do not necessarily equate to highest bids. In round 0, the highest bid was significantly lower than the perceived value (30 out of 44). In round 1, two identical bids (70 each) were offered against a common value of 74. Bidding 45 aims to strategically position my bid higher than conservative bids but still below my perceived value, allowing me to profit if the second-highest bid is similar to the previous rounds.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 24, I want to ensure that I make a profit if I win, while strategically aiming to bid lower to maximize profit. From the history of previous rounds, we see bids ranging from 14 to 70. Bidding 15 positions me with a decent chance to win if others undervalue this round, while keeping the bid low enough to maximize profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 38, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 49, and considering previous rounds, a bid in the mid-30s seems optimal. In round 0, a winning bid of 30 against a second-highest bid of 24 resulted in a profit, while in round 1, bidding high resulted in barely breaking even. Round 2's higher bid of 69 didn\u2019t yield as much profit as a strategic lower bid might have. In round 3, a lower bid closer to the second-highest bid would've been favorable. Therefore, bidding 38 aims to strike a balance between winning the auction and ensuring there's enough margin for a profit, considering past bid patterns and the moderate value of this round's prize.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 5, I need to bid very conservatively to avoid the risk of a loss. Historically, bids have varied significantly, and the second-highest bids have often been close but not overly high. By bidding 2, I position myself to potentially win with a minimal bid cost if the other bidders undervalue this round, but keep my risk very low with respect to the small prize value this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, and analyzing the previous rounds, it seems that the optimal strategy is to bid moderately to try to win without overbidding. In past rounds, bids have often been notably below the perceived value, especially when the perceived value varied greatly among bidders. Bidding 25 balances the aim to win with a prudent margin for profit if the second-highest bid follows the trends observed.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from very low to mid-range values. A perceived value of 50 indicates a medium-prize value. Typically, bidding slightly below but close to the perceived value (to ensure some profit if I win) has been effective. Considering past trends, other bidders may bid within the 20-35 range for comparable values. Thus, bidding 39 allows positioning to outbid lower, conservative bids while aiming to keep the margin above the second-highest bid reasonable for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 72, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but still leaving room for a significant profit. Based on previous rounds' bid patterns, where the highest bids ranged from 19 to 70 depending on the perceived value, I estimate a bid of 55 is moderate but competitive. This strategy aims to maximize the difference between my value and the payment required, hopefully lower than my bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 2, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9, I need to bid conservatively to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of loss. In previous rounds, low values were bid conservatively. For instance, in round 5, I bid 2 when my value was 5, which resulted in no gain or loss. Given the low value of 9 for this prize, a low bid will follow a similar strategy to avoid overbidding and risking a net loss. Thus, bidding 2 balances the possible win with minimal loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 44, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 59, I want to bid an amount that provides a good chance of winning while leaving room for a significant profit. In previous rounds, bid patterns showed that higher perceived values often had winning bids in the mid-to-high ranges. For example, in round 8, a perceived value of 72 had bids of 60, 55, and 36, with 60 winning. For a perceived value like 59, bidding 44 positions me competitively, considering that second-highest bids have often been lower and should allow for a decent profit margin if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 26, the (true) common value of the prize was 31, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 26, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 26. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 34, I need to balance the need to win the auction with ensuring a profit. In previous rounds, I have observed that bidding moderately within the range of 25-45 allows for a good chance to win without overbidding, particularly when the perceived value is in a similar range. For instance, in round 6, bidding 25 aimed to straddle this balance, though it was slightly low. Based on the trends, a bid of 26 aims to optimize for winning chances while balancing the profit margin if the second-highest bid remains around typical middle values.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 19, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 28 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I observe that moderate bids often provide a good balance between winning the prize and ensuring profit. For instance, previous bids in similar low-value rounds ranged from 15 to 30. To maximize profit and avoid overbidding, a bid of 19 positions me competitively while keeping the potential risk low if I win.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 25, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 32, I want to bid an amount that balances the chances of winning without overbidding, based on previous trends. In round 11, a bid of 26 for a value of 34 almost won, suggesting a bid slightly higher might be more competitive. This strategy also considers previous similar bids such as in rounds 6 and 12. Therefore, a bid of 27 aims to optimize my winning chances while ensuring a profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within anticipated ranges.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 86 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, I need to bid an amount that balances a high chance of winning the bid with ensuring a positive profit margin. Assuming the common value hovers around an average and previous rounds suggest aggressive bidding by others, I opt for a slightly conservative bid to ensure profits yet competitive enough to win. Thus, I bid 24.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 74, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 81, I want to make sure I have a high chance of winning without sacrificing too much of my profit. Based on previous rounds' bids, I need to bid competitively high. A bid of 70 provides a balanced mix of being competitive and ensuring a decent profit margin if I win, assuming other bidders also value the prize highly and bid close to their valuations.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 69, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my value for the prize is 69. Based on the history, bids tend to be aggressive and sometimes match high perceived values closely. To maximize my profit while increasing my chances of winning, I will bid my exact value since it matches a previous high winning bid and should be competitive enough.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 19. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 26, I need to ensure my bid is competitive but also profitable. In the previous rounds, bids ranged between 14 and 70, with reasonable competitors willing to bid high. To maximize my profit while still having a chance to win, I will bid 19. This ensures that if other bids are around their perceived values, I have a chance to win without drastically reducing my profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 38, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60, I will make a competitive bid of 55. From the previous rounds, I know bids can vary widely, but often close to the perceived value. My objective is to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable potential profit margin. By bidding 55, I strike a balance between being competitive and maximizing my profit based on the history of bidding behavior.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 6, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 4. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 6, bidding high would likely result in a loss if I win, considering previous rounds show aggressive bidding from competitors. I aim to bid conservatively to avoid overbidding, thereby maximizing long-term profits. A bid of 5 ensures I have a slim chance to win without risking too much.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, and analyzing the previous rounds where winning bids are often slightly below or equal to perceived values, I aim to bid competitively but within a range to still ensure a positive margin if I win. Therefore, I choose to bid 35, which is high enough to be competitive yet leaves potential for a decent profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 39, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 39. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 48, I need to bid an amount that is competitive enough to win while also ensuring a positive profit margin. I notice that high bids typically win, but paying close to the second-highest bid is crucial to maintain profit. Bidding 41 strikes a balance\u2014it is competitive without being too close to my perceived value, allowing room for a substantial profit if I win and the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 55, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 67, I want to ensure a competitive bid without bidding too close to my perceived value. Based on the history of previous rounds, bids that are slightly below perceived values tend to be effective. A bid of 60 balances being competitive while leaving room for a positive profit margin assuming the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 7, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 23. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 2, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 2. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 7 and analyzing previous rounds where higher bids often result in minimal or negative profits, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid any potential loss. A bid of 2 ensures that if I win (considering the others bid very low), I will still make a slight profit. This approach aligns with my goal of maximizing long-term profit while minimizing risk.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 44, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 44. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 53, I need to bid competitively enough to secure a win while leaving room for a profit. Based on previous rounds, winning bids often hover slightly below the perceived values, with the second-highest bid significantly lower. By bidding 45, I aim to balance being competitive and ensuring a positive profit margin if I win, assuming the second-highest bid will be lower. This strategy aligns with my goal of maximizing total profit through careful and competitive bidding.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 31, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 25. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 26, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 26. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 35, I want to bid an amount that is competitive yet leaves room for profit. Considering prior rounds where bids often exceeded the true value slightly, a bid of 28 should be competitive enough to potentially win while positioning myself for a positive profit if I win.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 19, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 19. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 25 for this round, I want to ensure my bid is competitive without being too close to my perceived value to allow for a profit margin. In previous rounds, winning bids have varied, but staying slightly conservative tends to yield a better profit. Bidding 20 gives me a chance to win if others bid lower and ensures a potential profit if I do win.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 30. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 25, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I want to bid an amount that balances the chance of winning while ensuring a positive profit. Previous rounds suggest that bids slightly below perceived values often win and are profitable if the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Therefore, a bid of 25 maintains competitiveness while maximizing potential profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 72 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

From the history, we can see that high bids often win but don't guarantee high profits due to the high second-highest bids. Therefore, bidding conservatively around 60% of my perceived value (10) should allow me a chance to win if the common value is closer to my perceived value, without risking too much loss if I don't win. A bid of 6 balances this strategy, acknowledging the competitive nature of the auctions while adhering to my lower perceived value.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for this round is 35, I will bid strategically by placing a bid slightly over half of my perceived value. Reviewing previous rounds, bidding around 45-60% of my perceived value allows a chance to win without overbidding. In the past, high bids have often incurred losses due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 18 balances the desire to potentially win without risking excessive losses.'

We have seen that high bids often result in losses due to substantial second-highest bids. Therefore, bidding around 50-60% of my perceived value (19) allows me a chance to win without overpaying drastically. A bid of 10 balances this strategy, considering the competitive nature of the other bidders while adhering to my lower perceived value.'

Historically, bids around 15 did not guarantee winning or securing a profit. Hence, I will bid 6, aiming to capture the prize at a relatively low cost if the other bidders' perceived values are also low, while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.'

In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids. By bidding 3, I position myself to potentially win if Andy and Betty also have lower perceived values, thereby minimizing potential loss while slightly favoring potential profit.'

From the round history, I've noticed the winning bid typically falls below the perceived value and closer to a middle range, considering the highest bids and payments made. By bidding 30, I position myself competitively to potentially win the prize without significant overpayment, thereby maximizing my total profit.'

In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids.

Analyzing previous rounds, Andy and Betty have bid anywhere from 1 to 70. Bidding around 30 positions me competitively, with enough margin to make a profit if I win the auction.

Factoring the competitive nature of auction and assuming others bid close to their perceived value, 70 is a balanced bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 69, the (true) common value of the prize was 65, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 15.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 69, 50, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous round, I bid 70 and tied with another bidder, leading to no profit for me. Since my value towards the prize is now 81, slightly higher than last time, I should still aim to bid below my perceived value to ensure profit if I win but not to overpay. Other bidders also put forward significant bids, so bidding just below my perceived value, at 69, might be strategic enough to win but still leave room for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for this round is only 5, it doesn't make sense to bid a high amount as that would lead to a potential loss. Judging from previous rounds, bids have been significantly higher (70, 69). To maximize my total profit, it is strategic to place a low bid, understanding that I likely won't win this round but will minimize potential losses.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value is 39, I aim to bid below my value to ensure potential profit if I win, but not overpay. Previous rounds saw significant bids, but a lower perceived value suggests others' bids might also be lower this round. Bidding 25 balances these factors to maximize profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22, it makes sense to bid low because the value is relatively low. The previous bidding patterns show varying bids, but in round 2, a low value resulted in the highest bidder paying a relatively high bid. By bidding 10, I aim to balance not overpaying while remaining competitive, assuming others with higher perceived values might bid higher, increasing my chances of net positive total profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9 in this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behavior, where bids tend to be significantly higher when bidders perceive higher values, it is strategic to bid low to avoid potential losses. With such a low perceived value, I'm unlikely to win this round, but by bidding 1, I ensure a minimal bid, preventing any significant loss while keeping the possibility open for an unexpectedly low bidding round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 6, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 24, it is strategic to place a bid below this value to ensure potential profit if I win while minimizing losses. Based on previous rounds, other bidders place significant bids when their perceived values are considerably higher. Bidding 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and not overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds where lower values generally result in lower bids, it is strategic to place a relatively low bid to avoid potential losses. Other bidders may also place lower bids if their perceived values are similar, but placing a slightly higher bid than the lowest historical bids might give me a competitive edge while minimizing risks.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 42 for this round, I want to balance bidding high enough to possibly win against the risk of overpaying and reducing my profit. From the round history, I've noticed the winning bid typically falls below the perceived value and closer to a middle range, considering the highest bids and payments made. By bidding 30, I position myself competitively to potentially win the prize without significant overpayment, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 27, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 27. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 37 and analyzing the previous rounds, it is evident that bidding significantly below the perceived value often provides a strategic edge. For instance, in previous rounds, bids lower than but close to the perceived value sometimes resulted in wins without overbidding. Bidding 27 positions me as a competitive bidder without overextending and still leaving room for profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round and considering previous round outcomes, it is strategic to bid conservatively. Lower bids often minimize losses and avoid overpayment. A bid of 10 balances staying competitive in case others bid higher and not overpaying, thus maximizing overall profits while minimizing risks.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 80 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

Hence, I will bid 6, aiming to capture the prize at a relatively low cost if the other bidders' perceived values are also low, while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 6, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it appears that conservative bidding is most appropriate when my perceived value is low. In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids. By bidding 3, I position myself to potentially win if Andy and Betty also have lower perceived values, thereby minimizing potential loss while slightly favoring potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 8 and based on previous rounds, conservative bidding seems optimal in maximizing overall profit while minimizing potential losses. Historical bids have shown that when my perceived value is low, other bidders like Andy and Betty also tend to bid lower. By bidding 2, I aim to stay competitive but cautious, which aligns with this strategy.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Analyzing previous rounds, Andy and Betty have bid anywhere from 1 to 70. Bidding around 30 positions me competitively, with enough margin to make a profit if I win the auction. Historically, bidding too high has led to small or negative profits, so a moderate bid of 30 seems optimal for maximizing profit while minimizing risk.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 27, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 27. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 52, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Examining the history, we see other bids range widely, but often they settle between 15 and 70. Based on examples where my perceived value has been 36, 49, or higher, bidding around 40 has proven to strike a balance between winning the prize and securing some profit. A bid of 40 is competitive enough to potentially win against typical bids from Andy and Betty while still leaving room for a net gain if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10, 10.

Given that my value is 85, bidding slightly below this value is strategic to ensure I gain a profit if I win but not overpay.

Since my value towards the prize is now 81, slightly higher than last time, I should still aim to bid below my perceived value to ensure profit if I win but not to overpay. Other bidders also put forward significant bids, so bidding just below my perceived value, at 69, might be strategic enough to win but still leave room for profit.'

Previous rounds saw significant bids, but a lower perceived value suggests others' bids might also be lower this round. Bidding 25 balances these factors to maximize profit.'

From the round history, I've noticed the winning bid typically falls below the perceived value and closer to a middle range, considering the highest bids and payments made.

For instance, in previous rounds, bids lower than but close to the perceived value sometimes resulted in wins without overbidding. Bidding 27 positions me as a competitive bidder without overextending and still leaving room for profit if I win.'

Previously, both Andy and Betty were willing to bid up to 70. To maximize my profit, I will bid somewhat conservatively at 50, anticipating that this might be enough to win if their perceived values are lower this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 16, I would like to maximize my total profit. In previous rounds, high bids have led to losses or marginal profits. Since the other bids have been relatively high, I will bid conservatively at 15, hoping to win only if their values are similarly low. This strategy minimizes potential losses if I do not win the auction.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I aim to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. In previous rounds, the winning bids have varied. Andy and Betty have shown a tendency to bid between 1 and 70. By bidding 40, I am positioning myself to potentially win the auction if the other bidders' perceived values are relatively low or moderate this round, while still ensuring a good profit margin if I do win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 16, I want to bid conservatively to avoid potential losses, especially since the common value could be low, as seen in round 2. Historically, bids around 15 did not guarantee winning or securing a profit. Hence, I will bid 6, aiming to capture the prize at a relatively low cost if the other bidders' perceived values are also low, while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it appears that conservative bidding is most appropriate when my perceived value is low. In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids. By bidding 3, I position myself to potentially win if Andy and Betty also have lower perceived values, thereby minimizing potential loss while slightly favoring potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 8 and based on previous rounds, conservative bidding seems optimal in maximizing overall profit while minimizing potential losses. Historical bids have shown that when my perceived value is low, other bidders like Andy and Betty also tend to bid lower. By bidding 2, I aim to stay competitive but cautious, which aligns with this strategy.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Analyzing previous rounds, Andy and Betty have bid anywhere from 1 to 70. Bidding around 30 positions me competitively, with enough margin to make a profit if I win the auction. Historically, bidding too high has led to small or negative profits, so a moderate bid of 30 seems optimal for maximizing profit while minimizing risk.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 27, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 27. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 52, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Examining the history, we see other bids range widely, but often they settle between 15 and 70. Based on examples where my perceived value has been 36, 49, or higher, bidding around 40 has proven to strike a balance between winning the prize and securing some profit. A bid of 40 is competitive enough to potentially win against typical bids from Andy and Betty while still leaving room for a net gain if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10, 10.

Looking at previous rounds, the highest bid fluctuated between 8 and 70, with bids around 40 being successful when my value was moderate to high.

Previous rounds saw significant bids, but a lower perceived value suggests others' bids might also be lower this round. Bidding 25 balances these factors to maximize profit.'

With such a low perceived value, I'm unlikely to win this round, but by bidding 1, I ensure a minimal bid, preventing any significant loss while keeping the possibility open for an unexpectedly low bidding round.'

Based on previous rounds, other bidders place significant bids when their perceived values are considerably higher. Bidding 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and not overpaying.'

Other bidders may also place lower bids if their perceived values are similar, but placing a slightly higher bid than the lowest historical bids might give me a competitive edge while minimizing risks.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 42 for this round, I want to balance bidding high enough to possibly win against the risk of overpaying and reducing my profit. From the round history, I've noticed the winning bid typically falls below the perceived value and closer to a middle range, considering the highest bids and payments made. By bidding 30, I position myself competitively to potentially win the prize without significant overpayment, thereby maximizing my total profit.'

For instance, in previous rounds, bids lower than but close to the perceived value sometimes resulted in wins without overbidding. Bidding 27 positions me as a competitive bidder without overextending and still leaving room for profit if I win.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round and considering previous round outcomes, it is strategic to bid conservatively. Lower bids often minimize losses and avoid overpayment. A bid of 10 balances staying competitive in case others bid higher and not overpaying, thus maximizing overall profits while minimizing risks.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 50.

In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids.

Analyzing previous rounds, Andy and Betty have bid anywhere from 1 to 70. Bidding around 30 positions me competitively, with enough margin to make a profit if I win the auction. Historically, bidding too high has led to small or negative profits, so a moderate bid of 30 seems optimal for maximizing profit while minimizing risk.'

Examining the history, we see other bids range widely, but often they settle between 15 and 70. Based on examples where my perceived value has been 36, 49, or higher, bidding around 40 has proven to strike a balance between winning the prize and securing some profit. A bid of 40 is competitive enough to potentially win against typical bids from Andy and Betty while still leaving room for a net gain if successful.'

Looking at previous rounds, the highest bid fluctuated between 8 and 70, with bids around 40 being successful when my value was moderate to high.

Given that my value is 85, bidding slightly below this value is strategic to ensure I gain a profit if I win but not overpay. Factoring the competitive nature of auction and assuming others bid close to their perceived value, 70 is a balanced bid.'

Since my value towards the prize is now 81, slightly higher than last time, I should still aim to bid below my perceived value to ensure profit if I win but not to overpay. Other bidders also put forward significant bids, so bidding just below my perceived value, at 69, might be strategic enough to win but still leave room for profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for this round is only 5, it doesn't make sense to bid a high amount as that would lead to a potential loss. Judging from previous rounds, bids have been significantly higher (70, 69). To maximize my total profit, it is strategic to place a low bid, understanding that I likely won't win this round but will minimize potential losses.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value is 39, I aim to bid below my value to ensure potential profit if I win, but not overpay. Previous rounds saw significant bids, but a lower perceived value suggests others' bids might also be lower this round. Bidding 25 balances these factors to maximize profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22, it makes sense to bid low because the value is relatively low. The previous bidding patterns show varying bids, but in round 2, a low value resulted in the highest bidder paying a relatively high bid. By bidding 10, I aim to balance not overpaying while remaining competitive, assuming others with higher perceived values might bid higher, increasing my chances of net positive total profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9 in this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behavior, where bids tend to be significantly higher when bidders perceive higher values, it is strategic to bid low to avoid potential losses. With such a low perceived value, I'm unlikely to win this round, but by bidding 1, I ensure a minimal bid, preventing any significant loss while keeping the possibility open for an unexpectedly low bidding round.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 24, it is strategic to place a bid below this value to ensure potential profit if I win while minimizing losses. Based on previous rounds, other bidders place significant bids when their perceived values are considerably higher. Bidding 15 strikes a balance between being competitive and not overpaying.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds where lower values generally result in lower bids, it is strategic to place a relatively low bid to avoid potential losses. Other bidders may also place lower bids if their perceived values are similar, but placing a slightly higher bid than the lowest historical bids might give me a competitive edge while minimizing risks.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 20.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 42 for this round, I want to balance bidding high enough to possibly win against the risk of overpaying and reducing my profit. From the round history, I've noticed the winning bid typically falls below the perceived value and closer to a middle range, considering the highest bids and payments made. By bidding 30, I position myself competitively to potentially win the prize without significant overpayment, thereby maximizing my total profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 27, 27.

For instance, in previous rounds, bids lower than but close to the perceived value sometimes resulted in wins without overbidding. Bidding 27 positions me as a competitive bidder without overextending and still leaving room for profit if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round and considering previous round outcomes, it is strategic to bid conservatively. Lower bids often minimize losses and avoid overpayment. A bid of 10 balances staying competitive in case others bid higher and not overpaying, thus maximizing overall profits while minimizing risks.'

Bidding 50 balances being competitive enough to win the bid without overbidding, considering others might not have as high a perceived value and their bids likely range around mid-values.'

In round 0, I bid 70 for a perceived value of 85, and although I tied, it was competitive. Considering the previous rounds, a bid of 70 is strategic to balance winning the prize and ensuring profit while minimizing the risk of overpayment.'

However, considering the high value in this round, I am slightly increasing my bid to around 56% of my perceived value (80). This should give me a competitive chance to win without risking excessive losses if the second-highest bid is lower.'

However, considering the higher value this round and aiming to maximize total profit, I choose to bid at the higher end of this range, around 54% of my perceived value. This strategy should give me a competitive chance to win while managing the risks associated with overbidding.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 10 for this round and the history of previous rounds, I have noticed that bidding around 50% to 60% of my perceived value has been a strategic balance between winning and not overbidding. By placing a bid of 5, I am adhering to this strategy, providing myself a fair chance to win without risking excessive loss if the second-highest bid is close to my bid.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 82, my goal is to maximize my profit. Given that I need to win the auction but also pay a smaller amount, I estimate that bidding 70 is likely to be high enough to win the auction yet low enough to ensure a decent profit margin.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 66, I aim to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Previously, both Andy and Betty were willing to bid up to 70. To maximize my profit, I will bid somewhat conservatively at 50, anticipating that this might be enough to win if their perceived values are lower this round.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 16, I would like to maximize my total profit. In previous rounds, high bids have led to losses or marginal profits. Since the other bids have been relatively high, I will bid conservatively at 15, hoping to win only if their values are similarly low. This strategy minimizes potential losses if I do not win the auction.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I aim to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. In previous rounds, the winning bids have varied. Andy and Betty have shown a tendency to bid between 1 and 70. By bidding 40, I am positioning myself to potentially win the auction if the other bidders' perceived values are relatively low or moderate this round, while still ensuring a good profit margin if I do win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 7.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 10, 10.

The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 27 and that previous rounds have shown Andy and Betty bidding within a range often between 1 and 70, I want to avoid overpaying and risking a loss. By bidding 20, I position myself to potentially win if Andy and Betty's perceived values are similarly low while still ensuring some profit margin if I do win.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 16, I want to bid conservatively to avoid potential losses, especially since the common value could be low, as seen in round 2. Historically, bids around 15 did not guarantee winning or securing a profit. Hence, I will bid 6, aiming to capture the prize at a relatively low cost if the other bidders' perceived values are also low, while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 6, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it appears that conservative bidding is most appropriate when my perceived value is low. In rounds where perceived values were low, bids have also tended to be low, and the risk of overpaying has been mitigated by lower bids. By bidding 3, I position myself to potentially win if Andy and Betty also have lower perceived values, thereby minimizing potential loss while slightly favoring potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 2, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 8 and based on previous rounds, conservative bidding seems optimal in maximizing overall profit while minimizing potential losses. Historical bids have shown that when my perceived value is low, other bidders like Andy and Betty also tend to bid lower. By bidding 2, I aim to stay competitive but cautious, which aligns with this strategy.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Analyzing previous rounds, Andy and Betty have bid anywhere from 1 to 70. Bidding around 30 positions me competitively, with enough margin to make a profit if I win the auction. Historically, bidding too high has led to small or negative profits, so a moderate bid of 30 seems optimal for maximizing profit while minimizing risk.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 27, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 27. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 52, I want to balance winning the auction with ensuring a significant profit. Examining the history, we see other bids range widely, but often they settle between 15 and 70. Based on examples where my perceived value has been 36, 49, or higher, bidding around 40 has proven to strike a balance between winning the prize and securing some profit. A bid of 40 is competitive enough to potentially win against typical bids from Andy and Betty while still leaving room for a net gain if successful.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25 and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, Andy and Betty tend to bid relatively close but often not very high for lower-value items. To maximize my profit while maintaining a competitive bid, I will bid 10, hoping to win if their perceived values are similarly low while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 25.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 95, I want to ensure I win the auction while also maximizing my profit. Looking at previous rounds, the highest bid fluctuated between 8 and 70, with bids around 40 being successful when my value was moderate to high. Since my value this round is notably high, I will bid 60 to balance the likelihood of winning with a substantial profit margin, expecting that a bid significantly lower than my perceived value but still competitive should secure the prize.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 96, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 96, I need a strategy that balances a high probability of winning with ensuring a healthy profit margin. In past rounds, a bid of 60 won with a high perceived value, and typical high bids ranged up to 70. To maximize my profit, I plan to bid 70, which should be competitive enough to win, while still leaving a substantial margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 16, I want to be conservative to avoid potential losses. Previous rounds with low perceived values have shown that conservative bids, such as 6 or 3, minimized losses even if I didn't win. Given that other bidders have also bid conservatively in such rounds, a bid of 5 positions me to potentially win if their perceived values are low, while minimizing potential losses if I do not win.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 79 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

Bidding 14 aims to balance the chance of winning while avoiding overbidding.

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54, and considering the past winning bids were 27, 25, 15, and 39, I aim to be competitive yet prudent. A bid of 37 is aggressive enough to have a good chance of winning but still gives room for a positive profit margin if I win and pay a slightly lower second-highest bid.'

Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 49 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 19 and the assumption I can't observe the other bidders' actual values and bids from earlier rounds, I aim to place a bid low enough to ensure potential profit if the competition bids are relatively minor. From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39.

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 19 and the assumption I can't observe the other bidders' actual values and bids from earlier rounds, I aim to place a bid low enough to ensure potential profit if the competition bids are relatively minor. From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39.

From the previous rounds, we observed that winning bids have typically been a bit lower than the perceived values but strategically placed to outbid competitors without overshooting significantly.

Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.'

From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39.

From the previous rounds, we observed that winning bids have typically been a bit lower than the perceived values but strategically placed to outbid competitors without overshooting significantly.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my value of 29, bidding too high might result in negative profit if I win but pay too much. Bidding 20 balances the possibility of winning while ensuring potential profit if I do win since the highest bid payment will be lower than or close to my value.'

Given my perceived value is 17 and understanding that bidding too high may result in a negative profit if I win, I should bid conservatively. By bidding 10, I have a reasonable chance to win the prize if other bidders value it similarly conservatively, while avoiding overbidding and risking negative profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 14. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 and observing that both previous winning bids (27 and 25) significantly exceeded my perceived values in those rounds, I will bid more conservatively but still competitively. Bidding 14 aims to balance the chance of winning while avoiding overbidding. It maximizes potential profit if my value closely ties with my competitors' values and avoids bidding too high, which led to losses for winners previously.'

The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 and the previous rounds' winning bids being relatively low (27, 25, 15), a bid of 35 is competitive enough to have a good chance of winning but still much below my perceived value to ensure a positive profit margin if successful.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 37, 30.

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54, and considering the past winning bids were 27, 25, 15, and 39, I aim to be competitive yet prudent. A bid of 37 is aggressive enough to have a good chance of winning but still gives room for a positive profit margin if I win and pay a slightly lower second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53, I want to bid high enough to have a competitive chance of winning, yet ensure a positive profit margin. Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.'

Previous winning bids have ranged from 25 to 55, with second-highest bids often in the mid-30s or lower. A bid of 36 aims to be competitive while managing the risk of overpaying.'

Observing previous rounds, winning bids have varied greatly, often exceeding perceived values and leading to negative profits for the winners. By bidding 12, I place a reasonably competitive bid without excessively risking a negative profit if I win and pay a high second-highest bid. This strategy should help in maximizing my total profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, the highest winning bids were around mid-30s to mid-50s, and higher bidders generally ended up paying too much, yielding minimal or negative profits.

From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

Bidding 20 balances the possibility of winning while ensuring potential profit if I do win since the highest bid payment will be lower than or close to my value.'

Bidding 14 aims to balance the chance of winning while avoiding overbidding. It maximizes potential profit if my value closely ties with my competitors' values and avoids bidding too high, which led to losses for winners previously.'

Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.'

Observing previous rounds, winning bids have varied greatly, often exceeding perceived values and leading to negative profits for the winners. By bidding 12, I place a reasonably competitive bid without excessively risking a negative profit if I win and pay a high second-highest bid. This strategy should help in maximizing my total profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, the highest winning bids were around mid-30s to mid-50s, and higher bidders generally ended up paying too much, yielding minimal or negative profits. A bid of 49 is set to outbid conservative to mid-range bids without risking the high negative profit margins experienced by winners with the highest bids.'

The previous high bids ranged from the mid-30s to mid-50s, with winners often paying around the mid-30s to mid-50s.

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 19 and the assumption I can't observe the other bidders' actual values and bids from earlier rounds, I aim to place a bid low enough to ensure potential profit if the competition bids are relatively minor. From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20).

From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39.

Knowing that the second-highest bids have been around the mid-to-high 30s, I strategically choose to bid 43. This bid balances the likelihood of winning the prize while leaving a reasonable margin to ensure a positive profit, given the trends of my competitors' bidding behaviors.'

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 75', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 15, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In order to maximize my profit while considering my value of 25, I want to place a bid that is low enough to ensure I don't overpay but high enough to potentially win against Betty and Charles. Based on the game dynamics and to ensure some profit margin, I choose to bid 20.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 22, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 35, and in the previous round, I observed the highest bid was 27 with the next highest bids both being 20, I\u2019ll bid slightly lower than my maximum perceived value to avoid overpaying. Although my perceived value is 35, aiming for 25 balances my goal of winning while maximizing profit, given the distribution of previous bids.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 14. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 9 for this round and the previous bidding history, I aim to place a relatively low bid to prevent overpaying. In the previous rounds, the bids were relatively high, so by bidding 10, I can avoid a significant loss even if I do not win. This strategy helps in maximizing my total profit across rounds by minimizing potential losses in lower-value rounds.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 50 this round, analyzing the previous bid patterns, Betty and Charles tend to bid in the range of 10 to 27. To maximize my total profit while maintaining a competitive edge, I aim to bid slightly higher than their average bids but stay well below my perceived value to avoid overpaying. Hence, I choose to bid 32.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 37, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40 this round, I observe that in previous rounds, the bids tend to be below the perceived values and higher bids usually hover around the 30-40 range. To maximize profit while increasing my chances of winning, I'll bid 30 which is reasonably competitive without overpaying.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 42, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 68 this round and analyzing the previous bids from Betty and Charles, higher bids have hovered around the 30-46 range. To maximize my total profit, I want to bid competitively but still leave room for profit if I win. Aiming slightly higher than their average bids should increase my chances of winning without risking too much overpay. Therefore, I choose to bid 42.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 36, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 46 and analyzing the previous bid patterns of Betty and Charles, higher bids have generally ranged between 35 and 55. To maximize my chance of winning without overpaying, I will bid 35, targeting a competitive bid that still leaves room for profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 12, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 this round, and analyzing the previous bid patterns of Betty and Charles, their bids tend to range from 10 to 55 with higher bids generally securing the win. However, since my value is relatively low, I aim to bid just high enough to have a chance without overcommitting. By bidding 15, I stay competitive but avoid significant overpayment.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 49. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 86 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive enough to win but still maximizes potential profit. Analyzing previous bids, the highest winning bids have ranged up to 55. By bidding 58, I am positioning myself above the highest historical bids, increasing my winning chances while still leaving room for profit based on my value.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 61 this round and learning from previous rounds, the winning bids have generally ranged around 30 to 55. To maximize my profit while still aiming to win, I'll bid 45. This bid is competitive enough based on historical data but also leaves room for profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 50, 48.

The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 77 for this round and analyzing the historical bidding patterns of Betty and Charles, previous highest winning bids have generally ranged between 15 and 65, with some outliers. To maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a profit if I do, bidding 50 provides a competitive edge without excessive overpayment.

Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.'

The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 46, I want to balance winning the prize and ensuring a positive profit margin. From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39. This bid is high enough to likely secure the prize but leaves room for profit considering the second-highest bid patterns.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 46, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 37, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 56, my goal is to strategically bid high enough to likely win but still leave room for a profitable margin. From the previous rounds, we observed that winning bids have typically been a bit lower than the perceived values but strategically placed to outbid competitors without overshooting significantly. Considering the historical bids by Andy and Betty, a bid of 46 gives me a good chance to secure the prize while keeping a reasonable buffer for profit within the context of familiar bidding patterns.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 42, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 65 and historical bidding patterns, I've observed that winning bids have been strategically placed just high enough to outbid competitors while allowing room for a profit margin. Considering my perceived value of 65 and aiming to maximize profit, I'll bid 55. This bid is high enough to likely win while leaving a sufficient profit margin if the second-highest bid is in the typical range of high 30s to low 40s.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 36, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 50 for this round and looking at the historical bids, I notice that previous winning bids tend to surpass other bidders by a safe margin without exhausting too much profit potential. Knowing that the second-highest bids have been around the mid-to-high 30s, I strategically choose to bid 43. This bid balances the likelihood of winning the prize while leaving a reasonable margin to ensure a positive profit, given the trends of my competitors' bidding behaviors.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 12, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 9 for this round and observing historical bidding patterns, it is unlikely that a bid will result in a net positive profit since other bidders have values and bids that typically exceed low values like this. Bidding 0 avoids risking any loss and preserves the current total profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 49. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 and the historical bidding patterns observed in previous rounds, I aim to bid slightly below my value to ensure a winning bid while leaving a buffer for profit. Previous winning bids have ranged between 39 and 55 when the perceived values were lower than current. A bid of 65 should be high enough to secure the win against Andy and Betty's typical bid behavior, while still keeping a significant margin for profit assuming their bids will range within the high 30s to low 50s.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 7.\\nYour total profit is 16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 55 for this round and analyzing the historical bidding patterns, previous winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to mid-50s, considering both Andy and Betty's behaviors. To maximize my total profit, I will choose a bid of 45. This bid is high enough to likely win the prize while allowing a decent margin for profit by not bidding too close to my total value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 13.\\nYour total profit is 29. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for this round and analyzing the historical bidding patterns, I aim to place a bid significantly below my perceived value to ensure a winning bid while maximizing the margin for profit. Previous winning bids have ranged in the mid-40s to mid-60s when perceived values were high.

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for this round, I aim to balance the need to bid competitively without risking overpaying. Observing previous rounds, winning bids have varied greatly, often exceeding perceived values and leading to negative profits for the winners. By bidding 12, I place a reasonably competitive bid without excessively risking a negative profit if I win and pay a high second-highest bid. This strategy should help in maximizing my total profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 49. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for this round, I need to bid competitively to win while ensuring a positive profit margin. Analyzing previous rounds, the highest winning bids were around mid-30s to mid-50s, and higher bidders generally ended up paying too much, yielding minimal or negative profits. A bid of 49 is set to outbid conservative to mid-range bids without risking the high negative profit margins experienced by winners with the highest bids.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round and the previous rounds' history of bids and winnings, I want to bid competitively without overpaying. The previous high bids ranged from the mid-30s to mid-50s, with winners often paying around the mid-30s to mid-50s. A bid of 41 is high enough to be competitive and has a good chance of winning while minimizing the risk of negative profit by overpaying. This approach balances the need to win with the need to maximize profit, considering past results.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 and the history of previous rounds where competitive bids often fall in the mid-30s to mid-50s range, a bid of 48 strikes a balance between being highly competitive and avoiding overpayment. This bid addresses the recurrent pattern of winners paying amounts in this range while aiming to ensure positive profit if I win and pay the second-highest bid. My strategy focuses on maximizing my total profit while bidding sufficiently to have a strong chance of winning.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 55, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69 for this round, I need to bid competitively to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a positive profit margin. Observing previous winning bids, they have typically fallen within the mid-30s to mid-50s range. A bid of 50 is strategically placed to outbid conservative to moderate bids without overpaying excessively, increasing my chances of winning with a manageable risk on profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 42 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I consider my value of 35 and the likely behaviors of the other bidders. Bidding lower than my perceived value but higher than a minimal bid allows me to win if the second bids are lower than mine, without excessively cutting into my potential profit. Hence, I choose a strategic bid of 27.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 26 and learning from the previous round where the second-highest bid was 20, I aim to maximize my potential profit by bidding slightly above the likely range of competitive bids without exceeding my value too much. This strategic bid of 22 allows me to potentially win with a reasonable margin for profit, minimizing the risk of overbidding and resulting in a net negative profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 14. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 19 and the assumption I can't observe the other bidders' actual values and bids from earlier rounds, I aim to place a bid low enough to ensure potential profit if the competition bids are relatively minor. From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20). Therefore, a strategic bid of 15 minimizes risks and leaves room for profit should the second-highest bid be lower, thus aligning with the trend without exceeding cautious optimism to win with lower negative profits.'

From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39. This bid is high enough to likely secure the prize but leaves room for profit considering the second-highest bid patterns.'

From the previous rounds, we observed that winning bids have typically been a bit lower than the perceived values but strategically placed to outbid competitors without overshooting significantly. Considering the historical bids by Andy and Betty, a bid of 46 gives me a good chance to secure the prize while keeping a reasonable buffer for profit within the context of familiar bidding patterns.'

Knowing that the second-highest bids have been around the mid-to-high 30s, I strategically choose to bid 43. This bid balances the likelihood of winning the prize while leaving a reasonable margin to ensure a positive profit, given the trends of my competitors' bidding behaviors.'

To maximize my profit while still aiming to win, I'll bid 45. This bid is competitive enough based on historical data but also leaves room for profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 77 for this round and analyzing the historical bidding patterns of Betty and Charles, previous highest winning bids have generally ranged between 15 and 65, with some outliers. To maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a profit if I do, bidding 50 provides a competitive edge without excessive overpayment. This strategy balances the probability of winning and maximizing relative profit based on my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for the prize this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning with securing a healthy profit margin. Analyzing previous rounds, higher bids that typically win range around 45 to 65. By bidding 55, I place myself in a competitive position to win, while potentially ensuring a profit if the second-highest bid is lower than 55.'

To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overpayment, I'll place a competitive bid of 32.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my value of 29, bidding too high might result in negative profit if I win but pay too much. Bidding 20 balances the possibility of winning while ensuring potential profit if I do win since the highest bid payment will be lower than or close to my value.'

Observing previous rounds where winning bids were 27, 25, 15, 39, and 46, and considering the frequency of second-highest bids around the mid-30s or lower, a bid of 38 strategically aims to outbid low to mid-range bids while managing the risk of overpaying.'

Observing previous rounds, winning bids have varied greatly, often exceeding perceived values and leading to negative profits for the winners. By bidding 12, I place a reasonably competitive bid without excessively risking a negative profit if I win and pay a high second-highest bid. This strategy should help in maximizing my total profit.'

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for this round, I need to bid competitively to win while ensuring a positive profit margin. Analyzing previous rounds, the highest winning bids were around mid-30s to mid-50s, and higher bidders generally ended up paying too much, yielding minimal or negative profits. A bid of 49 is set to outbid conservative to mid-range bids without risking the high negative profit margins experienced by winners with the highest bids.'

The previous high bids ranged from the mid-30s to mid-50s, with winners often paying around the mid-30s to mid-50s. A bid of 41 is high enough to be competitive and has a good chance of winning while minimizing the risk of negative profit by overpaying. This approach balances the need to win with the need to maximize profit, considering past results.'

This bid addresses the recurrent pattern of winners paying amounts in this range while aiming to ensure positive profit if I win and pay the second-highest bid. My strategy focuses on maximizing my total profit while bidding sufficiently to have a strong chance of winning.'

From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20). Therefore, a strategic bid of 15 minimizes risks and leaves room for profit should the second-highest bid be lower, thus aligning with the trend without exceeding cautious optimism to win with lower negative profits.'

In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round and the previous rounds' history of bids and winnings, I want to bid competitively without overpaying. The previous high bids ranged from the mid-30s to mid-50s, with winners often paying around the mid-30s to mid-50s. A bid of 41 is high enough to be competitive and has a good chance of winning while minimizing the risk of negative profit by overpaying. This approach balances the need to win with the need to maximize profit, considering past results.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 and the history of previous rounds where competitive bids often fall in the mid-30s to mid-50s range, a bid of 48 strikes a balance between being highly competitive and avoiding overpayment. This bid addresses the recurrent pattern of winners paying amounts in this range while aiming to ensure positive profit if I win and pay the second-highest bid. My strategy focuses on maximizing my total profit while bidding sufficiently to have a strong chance of winning.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 55, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69 for this round, I need to bid competitively to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a positive profit margin. Observing previous winning bids, they have typically fallen within the mid-30s to mid-50s range. A bid of 50 is strategically placed to outbid conservative to moderate bids without overpaying excessively, increasing my chances of winning with a manageable risk on profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 32, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 42 for this round and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I observe that previous winning bids typically range from mid-30s to mid-50s, with second-highest bids often falling in the lower to mid-30s or 40s. A bid of 30 is high enough to be competitive and maximize my chance of winning while managing the risk of negative profit by minimizing overpayment, thereby aiming to achieve a positive profit if I win and pay a similar second-highest bid.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 52, 45.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I consider my value of 35 and the likely behaviors of the other bidders. Bidding lower than my perceived value but higher than a minimal bid allows me to win if the second bids are lower than mine, without excessively cutting into my potential profit. Hence, I choose a strategic bid of 27.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 22, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 26 and learning from the previous round where the second-highest bid was 20, I aim to maximize my potential profit by bidding slightly above the likely range of competitive bids without exceeding my value too much. This strategic bid of 22 allows me to potentially win with a reasonable margin for profit, minimizing the risk of overbidding and resulting in a net negative profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 14. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 19 and the assumption I can't observe the other bidders' actual values and bids from earlier rounds, I aim to place a bid low enough to ensure potential profit if the competition bids are relatively minor. From the history, bidders tend to place bids within realistic bounds of their perceived values (e.g., Andy's 25 and 22 or Betty's 20). Therefore, a strategic bid of 15 minimizes risks and leaves room for profit should the second-highest bid be lower, thus aligning with the trend without exceeding cautious optimism to win with lower negative profits.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 6.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 35. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 46, I want to balance winning the prize and ensuring a positive profit margin. From previous rounds, the highest bid has typically been slightly above 20. To increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a buffer below my perceived value, I will bid 39. This bid is high enough to likely secure the prize but leaves room for profit considering the second-highest bid patterns.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 46, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 37, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 56, my goal is to strategically bid high enough to likely win but still leave room for a profitable margin. From the previous rounds, we observed that winning bids have typically been a bit lower than the perceived values but strategically placed to outbid competitors without overshooting significantly. Considering the historical bids by Andy and Betty, a bid of 46 gives me a good chance to secure the prize while keeping a reasonable buffer for profit within the context of familiar bidding patterns.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 65 and historical bidding patterns, I've observed that winning bids have been strategically placed just high enough to outbid competitors while allowing room for a profit margin. Considering my perceived value of 65 and aiming to maximize profit, I'll bid 55. This bid is high enough to likely win while leaving a sufficient profit margin if the second-highest bid is in the typical range of high 30s to low 40s.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 50 for this round and looking at the historical bids, I notice that previous winning bids tend to surpass other bidders by a safe margin without exhausting too much profit potential. Knowing that the second-highest bids have been around the mid-to-high 30s, I strategically choose to bid 43. This bid balances the likelihood of winning the prize while leaving a reasonable margin to ensure a positive profit, given the trends of my competitors' bidding behaviors.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 1, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 15, 12, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 15 and paid 12. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 9 for this round and observing historical bidding patterns, it is unlikely that a bid will result in a net positive profit since other bidders have values and bids that typically exceed low values like this. Bidding 0 avoids risking any loss and preserves the current total profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 9.\\nYour total profit is 9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 49. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 and the historical bidding patterns observed in previous rounds, I aim to bid slightly below my value to ensure a winning bid while leaving a buffer for profit. Previous winning bids have ranged between 39 and 55 when the perceived values were lower than current. A bid of 65 should be high enough to secure the win against Andy and Betty's typical bid behavior, while still keeping a significant margin for profit assuming their bids will range within the high 30s to low 50s.'
