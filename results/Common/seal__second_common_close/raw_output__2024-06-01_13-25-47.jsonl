From looking at previous rounds, bids have ranged around 57 and 36 as winning bids, so bidding around 45 balances not overpaying while still having a good chance at winning.'

From previous rounds, the winning bids have been around 36, 57, and 56 with second-highest bids close behind. Thus, based on the trend, a bid around 50 is strategic; it's competitive but leaves a margin for profit considering the value of 67.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67, I want to balance bidding high enough to win while ensuring a profit margin if I win. From previous rounds, the winning bids have been around 36, 57, and 56 with second-highest bids close behind. Thus, based on the trend, a bid around 50 is strategic; it's competitive but leaves a margin for profit considering the value of 67.'

In previous rounds, winning bids have been around the mid-50s to 70. I'll bid 55, balancing the need to win and ensuring a margin for profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 26 and taking into account previous rounds' bidding behaviors, I understand that bids range significantly. To maximize profit while balancing the risk of overpaying, I will bid below my perceived value. A bid of 20 offers a chance to win without excessive risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'With a value of 8 for this round's prize, I need to place a cautious bid to avoid overpaying, especially since my perceived value is low. Historically, winning bids have been considerably higher, often in the range of the 30s to 70s, with the second-highest bid not far behind.

In round 1, the highest bid was 57 with the second-highest at 49. Based on this, placing a bid of 56 should give me a strong chance to win without excessively overpaying.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 36, and in round 1, it was 57. In round 2, the highest bid was 56. This trend suggests that winning bids are often in the mid-50s range.

From previous rounds, we've seen successful bids range from the mid-50s to 70. Based on this trend and my calculated value, a bid of 60 should give me a good chance of securing the prize while minimizing potential loss.

Previous winning bids have typically been in the mid-50s to 70 range, indicating competitive bidding. By bidding 35, I balance a competitive bid without significantly overpaying if the second-highest bid is close in value, while ensuring a reasonable chance of winning.'

From the history, previous rounds have shown high variability in bids, with winning bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Placing a high bid relative to my value would likely result in a loss. A bid of 15 allows me to stay in contention with lower bids, optimizing my profit by minimizing potential overpayment.'

From the previous round, the winning bid was 36, which means the competition bids relatively high.

From previous rounds, the winning bids have been around 36, 57, and 56 with second-highest bids close behind.

To maximize profit while balancing the risk of overpaying, I will bid below my perceived value. A bid of 20 offers a chance to win without excessive risk.'

Historically, winning bids have been considerably higher, often in the range of the 30s to 70s, with the second-highest bid not far behind. By bidding 3, I minimize risk while preserving the opportunity for a profitable win if other bidders significantly undervalue the prize this round.'

To maximize my potential profit, I need to bid close to my perceived value since the probability of winning with a much higher bid is low and would lead to a loss even if I win.

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 33 for the prize, I need to bid below that to ensure a profit if I win. Considering strategic bids and the need to outbid others without overpaying, I choose to bid 30 to maximize my chances while retaining a margin for profit.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 49, 40, 37, 35, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 55 for the prize in this round, I want to ensure a profit if I win while considering the bids from previous rounds. In the last round, the highest bid was 36, and the second-highest was 34. I will pick a bid slightly lower than the perceived value to maximize profit without overpaying. This strategic bid allows me to stay competitive and leaves room for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 52, 51, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my current perceived value for the prize is 67, and taking into account the highest and second-highest bids from the previous rounds (36 and 34 in round 0, and 57 and 49 in round 1), bidding 52 should keep me competitive while maximizing potential profit. This allows me to avoid overpaying if I win, even if other bidders are aggressive.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65, 62, 61, 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the past bidding patterns, winning bids were 36, 57, and 56. The second-highest bids were close behind. With my perceived value of 78, I should bid aggressively but sensibly. Bidding 58 increases my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the likely range of second-highest bids around 55.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 56, 55, 55, 54, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 56. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous round's bids and outcomes, bidding slightly below my perceived value of 58 will help ensure I maintain a profit if I win. The highest bids have been aggressive, but the second-highest bids tend to be slightly lower. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the competitive nature of recent bids.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the winning bids were 36, 57, 56, 70, and 60, with second-highest bids ranging close below those amounts. With a perceived value of 30, I need to make sure my bid is low enough to ensure a profit if I win, while also staying competitive. Given these factors, bidding 25 balances the need to possibly outbid others and keeping a margin for profitability.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 3, 24, 20, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the bids have been quite aggressive and significantly higher than my perceived value. With a perceived value of only 9 this round, bidding too high would likely result in a net loss even if I win. Therefore, I will bid conservatively at 3 to avoid overpayment and to maximize my total profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 46. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and the past bidding behavior where highest bids were slightly above 50. Bidding 51 aims to be competitive without overpaying, ensuring a potential profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 54, 53, 50, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been aggressive, while the second-highest bids have been close behind. Given my perceived value of 60, bidding 54 allows me to stay competitive while maintaining a decent chance for profit if the second-highest bid is lower.

The historical range of winning bids typically falls between 36 to 70, with second-highest bids generally lower but in the same ballpark. A bid of 20 allows me to remain competitive at a lower perceived value while minimizing potential losses, especially since I haven't won in previous rounds and the highest bids have consistently been much higher than my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 69 for the prize, I should aim to bid a bit below my perceived value to ensure a good profit if I win. From looking at previous rounds, bids have ranged around 57 and 36 as winning bids, so bidding around 45 balances not overpaying while still having a good chance at winning.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65, 62, 61, 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67, I want to balance bidding high enough to win while ensuring a profit margin if I win. From previous rounds, the winning bids have been around 36, 57, and 56 with second-highest bids close behind. Thus, based on the trend, a bid around 50 is strategic; it's competitive but leaves a margin for profit considering the value of 67.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 56, 55, 55, 54, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 56. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize of 60, I want to bid an amount that's competitive enough to have a high chance of winning, while still leaving room for profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have been around the mid-50s to 70. I'll bid 55, balancing the need to win and ensuring a margin for profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 26 and taking into account previous rounds' bidding behaviors, I understand that bids range significantly. To maximize profit while balancing the risk of overpaying, I will bid below my perceived value. A bid of 20 offers a chance to win without excessive risk.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 3, 24, 20, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'With a value of 8 for this round's prize, I need to place a cautious bid to avoid overpaying, especially since my perceived value is low. Historically, winning bids have been considerably higher, often in the range of the 30s to 70s, with the second-highest bid not far behind. By bidding 3, I minimize risk while preserving the opportunity for a profitable win if other bidders significantly undervalue the prize this round.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 51, 46, 45, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 46. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 44 for the prize, my aim is to bid strategically to maximize my profit while balancing the risk of overpaying. From the previous rounds, winning bids have been as high as 70 and as low as 3, with recent winning bids in the mid-30s to 60s. Bidding 37 gives me a competitive chance to win without bidding too close to my value, leaving sufficient room for profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 54, 53, 50, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 54.

By bidding 47, I aim to be competitive enough to have a chance of winning while still leaving room for a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 68, 67, 65, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70.

From previous rounds, winning bids varied but often the second-highest bids hovered in the mid-50s to 70s.

The second-highest bids were close behind. With my perceived value of 78, I should bid aggressively but sensibly. Bidding 58 increases my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the likely range of second-highest bids around 55.'

The highest bids have been aggressive, but the second-highest bids tend to be slightly lower.

With a perceived value of 30, I need to make sure my bid is low enough to ensure a profit if I win, while also staying competitive. Given these factors, bidding 25 balances the need to possibly outbid others and keeping a margin for profitability.'

With a perceived value of only 9 this round, bidding too high would likely result in a net loss even if I win.

Given my perceived value of 60, bidding 54 allows me to stay competitive while maintaining a decent chance for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy balances the need to win the auction and avoiding overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 34. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 40, I aim to bid slightly below it to maximize profit while considering the second-highest bid will likely be close to the common value. Based on past rounds, my bids around this range have mostly won without overpaying excessively.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 49, 40, 37, 35, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 and past rounds' bid patterns, I choose to bid 49. This bid is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while aiming to keep the second-highest bid lower, maximizing my profit margin. Previous rounds suggest that winning bids are often close to perceived value, with second-highest bids typically a few units below the winner's bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 and examining the bid patterns from previous rounds, it seems bidders tend to bid below their perceived value. In Round 0, the second-highest bid was 34, and the winning bid was 36. In Round 1, the second-highest bid was 49, and the winning bid was 57. To maximize my profit, I aim to bid high enough to win while keeping the second-highest bid in mind. A bid of 55 positions me competitively to win by exceeding past second-highest bids while keeping a buffer to avoid overbidding substantially beyond the common value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65, 62, 61, 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65.

Previously, winning bids were frequently a few units below the perceived values, and the second-highest bids were close to the winning bids. By bidding 70, I position myself to win while aiming to keep the payment (second-highest bid) significantly below my value of 79, thus maximizing my total profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 56. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I observe that the second-highest bids tend to cluster quite closely to the true common value, usually a few units below the winning bid. Therefore, bidding 54 positions me competitively to win while keeping the bid below my perceived value of 58, reducing the risk of overbidding relative to the common value and increasing my potential profit by having the second-highest bid likely lower than 54.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20.

The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 28, I aim to bid below this value to maximize my profit while increasing my chances of winning by analyzing past rounds' bid patterns. Previous rounds indicate that the winning bids are often close to the perceived value, with second-highest bids generally a few units lower. Thus, a bid of 24 positions me competitively to win without significantly risking overpayment compared to the common value.'

In round 1, the highest bid was 57 with the second-highest at 49. Based on this, placing a bid of 56 should give me a strong chance to win without excessively overpaying.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 36, and in round 1, it was 57. In round 2, the highest bid was 56. This trend suggests that winning bids are often in the mid-50s range. By bidding 65, I aim to secure the win while avoiding overpayment, taking into account my higher perceived value.'

From previous rounds, we've seen successful bids range from the mid-50s to 70. Based on this trend and my calculated value, a bid of 60 should give me a good chance of securing the prize while minimizing potential loss. This bid aligns closely with the value of the prize and maximizes the likelihood of covering the second-highest bid, optimizing my total profit.'

Previous winning bids have typically been in the mid-50s to 70 range, indicating competitive bidding. By bidding 35, I balance a competitive bid without significantly overpaying if the second-highest bid is close in value, while ensuring a reasonable chance of winning.'

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for the prize, I aim to make a bid that is strategically low while retaining a slim possibility of winning without overpaying. From the history, previous rounds have shown high variability in bids, with winning bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Placing a high bid relative to my value would likely result in a loss. A bid of 15 allows me to stay in contention with lower bids, optimizing my profit by minimizing potential overpayment.'

Historical bid data indicates that the winning bids have ranged widely, with some mid-50s to 70s, and others significantly lower. A bid of 45 is competitive enough to potentially secure the prize while giving some leeway for the second-highest bid to ensure a profit if I win.'

Given past bid behavior, with winning bids ranging from low 30s to mid-50s, I want to ensure a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 50 provides a strong chance to win, while likely avoiding a scenario where the second-highest bid drastically reduces my profit.'

In previous rounds, winning bids have been slightly lower or close to 70, with bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Bidding 70 increases my chances of winning without excessively overpaying, especially aiming to avoid bidding higher than necessary to secure the prize and still make a reasonable profit.'

Previous rounds show winning bids typically around the mid-50s to low-70s range, but often overpaying slightly reduces profit. By bidding 50, I stay competitive, increase my chances of winning, and avoid losing too much if the second-highest bid is close.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 49, 40, 37, 35, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 55 for the prize in this round, I want to ensure a profit if I win while considering the bids from previous rounds. In the last round, the highest bid was 36, and the second-highest was 34. I will pick a bid slightly lower than the perceived value to maximize profit without overpaying. This strategic bid allows me to stay competitive and leaves room for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 52, 51, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my current perceived value for the prize is 67, and taking into account the highest and second-highest bids from the previous rounds (36 and 34 in round 0, and 57 and 49 in round 1), bidding 52 should keep me competitive while maximizing potential profit. This allows me to avoid overpaying if I win, even if other bidders are aggressive.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65, 62, 61, 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the past bidding patterns, winning bids were 36, 57, and 56. The second-highest bids were close behind. With my perceived value of 78, I should bid aggressively but sensibly. Bidding 58 increases my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the likely range of second-highest bids around 55.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 56, 55, 55, 54, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 56. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous round's bids and outcomes, bidding slightly below my perceived value of 58 will help ensure I maintain a profit if I win. The highest bids have been aggressive, but the second-highest bids tend to be slightly lower. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the competitive nature of recent bids.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the winning bids were 36, 57, 56, 70, and 60, with second-highest bids ranging close below those amounts. With a perceived value of 30, I need to make sure my bid is low enough to ensure a profit if I win, while also staying competitive. Given these factors, bidding 25 balances the need to possibly outbid others and keeping a margin for profitability.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 3, 24, 20, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the bids have been quite aggressive and significantly higher than my perceived value. With a perceived value of only 9 this round, bidding too high would likely result in a net loss even if I win. Therefore, I will bid conservatively at 3 to avoid overpayment and to maximize my total profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 51, 46, 45, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 46. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and the past bidding behavior where highest bids were slightly above 50. Bidding 51 aims to be competitive without overpaying, ensuring a potential profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 54, 53, 50, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been aggressive, while the second-highest bids have been close behind. Given my perceived value of 60, bidding 54 allows me to stay competitive while maintaining a decent chance for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy balances the need to win the auction and avoiding overpayment.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 68, 67, 65, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70.

Reviewing past rounds, we observed highest bids in the 50s and 60s with close second-highest bids. I estimate that bidding 65 will give me a good chance of winning while aiming for a second-highest bid that ensures a solid profit margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 50, 49, 48, 42.

By bidding 55, I aim to remain competitive enough to win the auction while avoiding overpayment, thereby maximizing my potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 63 and the historical trends, the highest bids have often been in the mid to high 50s, with second-highest bids trailing close behind. Therefore, bidding 57 allows me to remain highly competitive while aiming to win the auction without overpaying.

To maximize my profit, I aim to bid high enough to win while keeping the second-highest bid in mind. A bid of 55 positions me competitively to win by exceeding past second-highest bids while keeping a buffer to avoid overbidding substantially beyond the common value.'

Previously, winning bids were frequently a few units below the perceived values, and the second-highest bids were close to the winning bids. By bidding 70, I position myself to win while aiming to keep the payment (second-highest bid) significantly below my value of 79, thus maximizing my total profit.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I observe that the second-highest bids tend to cluster quite closely to the true common value, usually a few units below the winning bid. Therefore, bidding 54 positions me competitively to win while keeping the bid below my perceived value of 58, reducing the risk of overbidding relative to the common value and increasing my potential profit by having the second-highest bid likely lower than 54.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20.

Previous rounds indicate that the winning bids are often close to the perceived value, with second-highest bids generally a few units lower. Thus, a bid of 24 positions me competitively to win without significantly risking overpayment compared to the common value.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 36, and in round 1, it was 57. In round 2, the highest bid was 56. This trend suggests that winning bids are often in the mid-50s range. By bidding 65, I aim to secure the win while avoiding overpayment, taking into account my higher perceived value.'

From previous rounds, we've seen successful bids range from the mid-50s to 70. Based on this trend and my calculated value, a bid of 60 should give me a good chance of securing the prize while minimizing potential loss. This bid aligns closely with the value of the prize and maximizes the likelihood of covering the second-highest bid, optimizing my total profit.'

Previous winning bids have typically been in the mid-50s to 70 range, indicating competitive bidding. By bidding 35, I balance a competitive bid without significantly overpaying if the second-highest bid is close in value, while ensuring a reasonable chance of winning.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 3, 24, 20, 15, 15.

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for the prize, I aim to make a bid that is strategically low while retaining a slim possibility of winning without overpaying. From the history, previous rounds have shown high variability in bids, with winning bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Placing a high bid relative to my value would likely result in a loss. A bid of 15 allows me to stay in contention with lower bids, optimizing my profit by minimizing potential overpayment.'

Historical bid data indicates that the winning bids have ranged widely, with some mid-50s to 70s, and others significantly lower. A bid of 45 is competitive enough to potentially secure the prize while giving some leeway for the second-highest bid to ensure a profit if I win.'

Given past bid behavior, with winning bids ranging from low 30s to mid-50s, I want to ensure a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 50 provides a strong chance to win, while likely avoiding a scenario where the second-highest bid drastically reduces my profit.'

In previous rounds, winning bids have been slightly lower or close to 70, with bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Bidding 70 increases my chances of winning without excessively overpaying, especially aiming to avoid bidding higher than necessary to secure the prize and still make a reasonable profit.'

This strategic bid allows me to stay competitive and leaves room for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 52, 51, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my current perceived value for the prize is 67, and taking into account the highest and second-highest bids from the previous rounds (36 and 34 in round 0, and 57 and 49 in round 1), bidding 52 should keep me competitive while maximizing potential profit. This allows me to avoid overpaying if I win, even if other bidders are aggressive.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 65, 62, 61, 58, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the past bidding patterns, winning bids were 36, 57, and 56. The second-highest bids were close behind. With my perceived value of 78, I should bid aggressively but sensibly. Bidding 58 increases my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the likely range of second-highest bids around 55.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 56, 55, 55, 54, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 56. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous round's bids and outcomes, bidding slightly below my perceived value of 58 will help ensure I maintain a profit if I win. The highest bids have been aggressive, but the second-highest bids tend to be slightly lower. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the competitive nature of recent bids.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 24, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the winning bids were 36, 57, 56, 70, and 60, with second-highest bids ranging close below those amounts. With a perceived value of 30, I need to make sure my bid is low enough to ensure a profit if I win, while also staying competitive. Given these factors, bidding 25 balances the need to possibly outbid others and keeping a margin for profitability.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 3, 24, 20, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, the bids have been quite aggressive and significantly higher than my perceived value. With a perceived value of only 9 this round, bidding too high would likely result in a net loss even if I win. Therefore, I will bid conservatively at 3 to avoid overpayment and to maximize my total profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 51, 46, 45, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 46. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 and the past bidding behavior where highest bids were slightly above 50. Bidding 51 aims to be competitive without overpaying, ensuring a potential profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 54, 53, 50, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been aggressive, while the second-highest bids have been close behind. Given my perceived value of 60, bidding 54 allows me to stay competitive while maintaining a decent chance for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy balances the need to win the auction and avoiding overpayment.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 68, 67, 65, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for the prize, I want to balance being competitive with avoiding overpayment. Reviewing past rounds, we observed highest bids in the 50s and 60s with close second-highest bids. I estimate that bidding 65 will give me a good chance of winning while aiming for a second-highest bid that ensures a solid profit margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 50, 49, 48, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 61 and the bidding patterns from previous rounds, past highest bids have typically ranged from the mid-50s to low-70s, with second-highest bids falling slightly below. By bidding 55, I aim to remain competitive enough to win the auction while avoiding overpayment, thereby maximizing my potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 57, 55, 52, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 63 and the historical trends, the highest bids have often been in the mid to high 50s, with second-highest bids trailing close behind. Therefore, bidding 57 allows me to remain highly competitive while aiming to win the auction without overpaying. This strategy aims to maximize the potential profit by ensuring I don't pay more than the second-highest bid, while also factoring in the likelihood of being the highest bid.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 60, 58, 55, 53, 50.

The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 72 for the prize in this round, I aim to bid in a range that is competitive yet ensures a margin for profit. Reviewing past rounds, winning bids tend to be in the 50s to 70s. Specifically, recent highest bids were 75, 56, and 59, while second-highest bids were just slightly lower.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 and examining the bid patterns from previous rounds, it seems bidders tend to bid below their perceived value. In Round 0, the second-highest bid was 34, and the winning bid was 36. In Round 1, the second-highest bid was 49, and the winning bid was 57. To maximize my profit, I aim to bid high enough to win while keeping the second-highest bid in mind. A bid of 55 positions me competitively to win by exceeding past second-highest bids while keeping a buffer to avoid overbidding substantially beyond the common value.'

Previously, winning bids were frequently a few units below the perceived values, and the second-highest bids were close to the winning bids. By bidding 70, I position myself to win while aiming to keep the payment (second-highest bid) significantly below my value of 79, thus maximizing my total profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 56, 55, 55, 54, 42.

Therefore, bidding 54 positions me competitively to win while keeping the bid below my perceived value of 58, reducing the risk of overbidding relative to the common value and increasing my potential profit by having the second-highest bid likely lower than 54.'

Previous rounds indicate that the winning bids are often close to the perceived value, with second-highest bids generally a few units lower. Thus, a bid of 24 positions me competitively to win without significantly risking overpayment compared to the common value.'

In round 1, the highest bid was 57 with the second-highest at 49. Based on this, placing a bid of 56 should give me a strong chance to win without excessively overpaying.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 36, and in round 1, it was 57. In round 2, the highest bid was 56. This trend suggests that winning bids are often in the mid-50s range. By bidding 65, I aim to secure the win while avoiding overpayment, taking into account my higher perceived value.'

From previous rounds, we've seen successful bids range from the mid-50s to 70. Based on this trend and my calculated value, a bid of 60 should give me a good chance of securing the prize while minimizing potential loss. This bid aligns closely with the value of the prize and maximizes the likelihood of covering the second-highest bid, optimizing my total profit.'

Previous winning bids have typically been in the mid-50s to 70 range, indicating competitive bidding. By bidding 35, I balance a competitive bid without significantly overpaying if the second-highest bid is close in value, while ensuring a reasonable chance of winning.'

From the history, previous rounds have shown high variability in bids, with winning bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Placing a high bid relative to my value would likely result in a loss. A bid of 15 allows me to stay in contention with lower bids, optimizing my profit by minimizing potential overpayment.'

Historical bid data indicates that the winning bids have ranged widely, with some mid-50s to 70s, and others significantly lower. A bid of 45 is competitive enough to potentially secure the prize while giving some leeway for the second-highest bid to ensure a profit if I win.'

Given past bid behavior, with winning bids ranging from low 30s to mid-50s, I want to ensure a competitive bid without overpaying.

In previous rounds, winning bids have been slightly lower or close to 70, with bids ranging from mid-50s to 70s. Bidding 70 increases my chances of winning without excessively overpaying, especially aiming to avoid bidding higher than necessary to secure the prize and still make a reasonable profit.'

Previous rounds show winning bids typically around the mid-50s to low-70s range, but often overpaying slightly reduces profit.

In the last round, the highest bid was 36, and the second-highest was 34. I will pick a bid slightly lower than the perceived value to maximize profit without overpaying.

The second-highest bids were close behind. With my perceived value of 78, I should bid aggressively but sensibly. Bidding 58 increases my chances of winning without overpaying, considering the likely range of second-highest bids around 55.'

With a perceived value of 30, I need to make sure my bid is low enough to ensure a profit if I win, while also staying competitive.

With a perceived value of only 9 this round, bidding too high would likely result in a net loss even if I win. Therefore, I will bid conservatively at 3 to avoid overpayment and to maximize my total profit.'

Given my perceived value of 60, bidding 54 allows me to stay competitive while maintaining a decent chance for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This strategy balances the need to win the auction and avoiding overpayment.'

Reviewing past rounds, we observed highest bids in the 50s and 60s with close second-highest bids. I estimate that bidding 65 will give me a good chance of winning while aiming for a second-highest bid that ensures a solid profit margin.'

By bidding 55, I aim to remain competitive enough to win the auction while avoiding overpayment, thereby maximizing my potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

Therefore, bidding 57 allows me to remain highly competitive while aiming to win the auction without overpaying. This strategy aims to maximize the potential profit by ensuring I don't pay more than the second-highest bid, while also factoring in the likelihood of being the highest bid.'

Reviewing past rounds, winning bids tend to be in the 50s to 70s. Specifically, recent highest bids were 75, 56, and 59, while second-highest bids were just slightly lower. Bidding 62 should make me competitive enough to outbid others while allowing for a profit margin if the second-highest bid is slightly below my bid.'

In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 55, 50, 49, 48, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, the highest bids have typically ranged from 35 to 75, with the second-highest bids often between 33 and 70. To maximize my total profit, I'll aim to bid slightly above the mid-range of the second-highest bids, which positions me well to potentially win the auction without overbidding excessively. A bid of 48 should balance the need to be competitive and the goal of maintaining a good profit margin if the second-highest bid follows past trends.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 57, 55, 52, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 60 for the prize this round, I want to maximize my total profit while considering past bidding patterns. From the previous rounds, the highest bids have generally ranged from 35 to 75, with second-highest bids typically being between 33 and 70. To increase my chances of winning while ensuring I still make a profit, I'll bid slightly above the mid-range of the second-highest bids observed, which has often been around the 50s. This competitive bid should balance the likelihood of winning and maintaining a good margin for profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 60, 58, 55, 53, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 63 for the prize this round and based on the previous rounds' bidding history, the second-highest bids have often ranged from the mid-40s to the mid-50s. To maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a good profit margin, I will bid 53, which is competitive based on historical patterns and leaves a reasonable margin for profit if the second-highest bid is around the same range.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 3, 3, 3, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17 for the prize this round and analyzing the history of previous rounds, most winning bids are significantly higher than my current value. To maximize my profit, I need to bid close to my value. Thus, a bid of 15 is competitive without significantly risking a loss if I win.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 84 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds.
