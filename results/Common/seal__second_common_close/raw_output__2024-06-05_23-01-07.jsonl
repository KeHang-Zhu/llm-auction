In previous rounds, the winning bid and second-highest bids varied, but a bid slightly above the average of past winning bids might maximize my chances. The notable bids so far in the rounds were 62, 55, and 25, indicating higher bids can still be relatively competitive without exceeding my value.

In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 81, 70, 69, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 81 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high value of 87 for the prize, I want to make a competitive bid while ensuring I leave enough margin for profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have ranged from 23 to 73, with winners generally bidding close to their perceived values but still maintaining a margin for the second-highest bid. By bidding 70, I increase my chances of winning while accounting for a potentially high second-highest bid, maximizing my total profit potential for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 40 for the prize and considering previous rounds where bids have ranged from 10 to 81, an effective strategy is to bid below my value to ensure a potential profit while still being competitive. Bidding 30 leaves room for a positive margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 75, 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 85 and analyzing the previous rounds, I noticed successful bids often hover slightly below the perceived value. To maximize profit, bidding 75 keeps me competitive to win while ensuring the second-highest bid leaves some room for profit. This approach aligns with the observed pattern where winners typically bid relatively high but leave a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 36 and my past bids, I have observed that bidding slightly below my perceived value can still be competitive while ensuring a better profit margin if I win. In past rounds, the highest bids often exceeded 50 when values were high, but they stayed around the 20-30 range for medium values. I will bid 27 to balance competitiveness and potential profit, considering the variability of second-highest bids.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 50 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

From the previous round\u2019s history, the winning bid was 25, and this bid was relatively high compared to the others. By bidding 40, I increase my chances of winning while still maintaining a sufficient margin for profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be lower.'

In previous rounds, high bids were around the 55 to 62 range, but not everyone bid that high, suggesting room for strategic lower bids. By bidding 23, I balance the risk and potential reward, accounting for fluctuating bids and aiming to win without overpaying.'

In previous rounds, the winning bid and second-highest bids varied, but a bid slightly above the average of past winning bids might maximize my chances. The notable bids so far in the rounds were 62, 55, and 25, indicating higher bids can still be relatively competitive without exceeding my value.

Previous rounds show that reasonably high bids tend to win, with winning bids varying from 23 to 73 and second-highest bids up to 61.

Previous rounds indicate that winning bids have been higher when values are high.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 26, and knowing from the history that the bids have varied widely and sometimes went up to as high as 62 in competitive rounds, I need to bid strategically. A bid of 18 gives me a chance to win if the others' perceived values are not as high but still leaves room for a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid is reasonable. This approach balances risk and profit potential while acknowledging that values and bids will vary independently each round.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 73, 61, 60, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high value of 82 for the prize in this round, I aim to maximize my profit while being competitive. In previous rounds, bids have varied widely, and winners often bid significantly but left room for a margin. I'll bid 60 to balance between a strong bid to win and leaving space for a second-highest bid to ensure a profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 81, 70, 69, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 81 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high value of 87 for the prize, I want to make a competitive bid while ensuring I leave enough margin for profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have ranged from 23 to 73, with winners generally bidding close to their perceived values but still maintaining a margin for the second-highest bid. By bidding 70, I increase my chances of winning while accounting for a potentially high second-highest bid, maximizing my total profit potential for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 40 for the prize and considering previous rounds where bids have ranged from 10 to 81, an effective strategy is to bid below my value to ensure a potential profit while still being competitive. Bidding 30 leaves room for a positive margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 75, 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 85 and analyzing the previous rounds, I noticed successful bids often hover slightly below the perceived value. To maximize profit, bidding 75 keeps me competitive to win while ensuring the second-highest bid leaves some room for profit. This approach aligns with the observed pattern where winners typically bid relatively high but leave a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 36 and my past bids, I have observed that bidding slightly below my perceived value can still be competitive while ensuring a better profit margin if I win. In past rounds, the highest bids often exceeded 50 when values were high, but they stayed around the 20-30 range for medium values. I will bid 27 to balance competitiveness and potential profit, considering the variability of second-highest bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 28, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 50 for the prize, I need to bid strategically to ensure a good chance of winning while not overshooting my bid to leave room for a positive profit. In the past rounds, winning bids have generally been around 70-80 for high perceived values and 20-30 for medium-low values. A bid of 38 is somewhat conservative but competitive, and it gives me a good chance to stay below any higher bids, ensuring I pay less if I win and hence maximize my profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 7, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 7 in this round, and considering the history where bids have varied widely, I should aim to bid conservatively to avoid a net loss. Bidding 5 allows me to stay competitive while maximizing the potential for a small profit if other bidders have low perceived values this round.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize profit if I win. By bidding 20, I increase my chances of winning against other bidders who might also perceive the value around the same range, while ensuring that if I win, the difference between the common prize value (which is part of my perceived value) and the second-highest bid will provide a positive return.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My perceived value for the prize is 71. Given the historical bids, including the highest bid of 25 last round, I aim to bid aggressively to ensure I win the prize, but still leave some margin below my perceived value to secure a positive profit. Bidding 62 should outbid competitors while aiming for the second-highest bid to be comfortably below this amount.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 23, 18, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 23 and paid 18. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 21, I will bid below my perceived value to maximize potential profit while accounting for the aggressive bidding pattern observed in previous rounds. A bid of 18 balances my chance of winning with the strategy of staying competitive if the second-highest bid is close to the current round\u2019s perceived values.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 73, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 7.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 73, 61, 60, 51. The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 83, I anticipate that competitive bidding may reach high levels, but historically, winners have often bid significantly lower than their perceived values. By bidding 73, I am staying conservative enough to ensure a higher profit margin if I win while bidding high enough to outbid competitors.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 81, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 81, 70, 69, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 81 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 92, I will bid 81. Historically, the highest winning bids have been between the range of 61 to 73. By bidding 81, I aim to secure the win, ensuring a comfortable margin over other competitors, while still leaving room for profit by hoping the second-highest bid to be sufficiently lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 41 and considering the history of winning bids and the profit margins, I will bid 36. This is slightly below my perceived value to ensure a good profit margin if I win, while still being competitive against other bidders who may have similar perceived values. Previous rounds have shown a trend of competitive but not excessively high bids, so 36 should be a strategic bid for this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 75, 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 87, and based on the historical winning bids and profits in previous rounds, I will bid 75. This is slightly below my perceived value to ensure a good profit margin if I win, while aiming to outbid the other bidders, considering the competitive nature of past rounds. Previous rounds have shown that winning bids tend to be slightly lower than perceived values but still competitive enough to secure the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 27, and analyzing the historical bids, I notice that bids slightly lower than the perceived value can still be competitive while maximizing profit. Historically, the highest bids tend to range around the midpoint of other perceived values, so bidding 22 allows me to stay competitive while ensuring a good margin if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 28, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 34, and considering the historical trends in the bids, it is evident that bidding slightly below my value could increase my chances of winning while ensuring a positive margin if I win. The historical data shows that winning bids are often slightly below the perceived value, and second-highest bids often trail reasonably close behind. Thus, I aim for a competitive yet cautious bid of 28 to maximize potential profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 27, and considering the historical trends in the bids, I observe that bidding slightly below my perceived value often remains competitive while maximizing potential profit. Historical bids show that the highest bids are typically close to but not exceeding perceived values, and a bid around 22 should position me well to potentially win while maximizing profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 26. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 37, and considering historical trends where winning bids are often competitive but slightly lower than perceived values, I aim to balance winning the bid and maximizing profit. I noticed from previous rounds that bids close to the mid-to-high twenties often win when perceived values aren\u2019t too high. Bidding 32 should be competitive enough to win while ensuring the second-highest bid allows for a positive profit margin.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 38 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for this round, I need to bid strategically below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit margin if I win. In previous rounds, the winning bid and second-highest bids varied, but a bid slightly above the average of past winning bids might maximize my chances. The notable bids so far in the rounds were 62, 55, and 25, indicating higher bids can still be relatively competitive without exceeding my value. By bidding 51, I balance the potential for winning against the risk of paying too much and ensure a decent profit if my bid is successful.'

Previous rounds show that reasonably high bids tend to win, with winning bids varying from 23 to 73 and second-highest bids up to 61. By bidding 60, I aim to stay ahead of most competitors without bidding too close to my full value, thus maintaining a healthy margin between my bid and the second-highest bid for potential profit.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 79, I want to bid strategically below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit margin if I win. From the history of previous rounds, the highest winning bids have tended to range from 23 to 81, with second-highest bids generally being lower by around 10-20 units. By bidding 65, I increase my chances of winning the auction while maintaining a sufficient margin for profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be lower than my bid.'

Previous rounds show that bids from others can range widely, but lower bids often are around 16-20. By bidding 18, I balance the chance of winning the auction and securing a profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid will remain below my perceived value.'

Based on the history of previous rounds, winning bids and second-highest bids vary significantly. To increase my chances while remaining competitive and maintaining a healthy margin between my bid and the second-highest bid, I will bid 35. This bid is intended to balance the risk and reward effectively.'

In past rounds, the highest bids often exceeded 50 when values were high, but they stayed around the 20-30 range for medium values.

In the past rounds, winning bids have generally been around 70-80 for high perceived values and 20-30 for medium-low values. A bid of 38 is somewhat conservative but competitive, and it gives me a good chance to stay below any higher bids, ensuring I pay less if I win and hence maximize my profit.'

This is slightly below my perceived value to ensure a good profit margin if I win, while still being competitive against other bidders who may have similar perceived values. Previous rounds have shown a trend of competitive but not excessively high bids, so 36 should be a strategic bid for this round.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 75, 70, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 87, and based on the historical winning bids and profits in previous rounds, I will bid 75. This is slightly below my perceived value to ensure a good profit margin if I win, while aiming to outbid the other bidders, considering the competitive nature of past rounds. Previous rounds have shown that winning bids tend to be slightly lower than perceived values but still competitive enough to secure the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 27, and analyzing the historical bids, I notice that bids slightly lower than the perceived value can still be competitive while maximizing profit. Historically, the highest bids tend to range around the midpoint of other perceived values, so bidding 22 allows me to stay competitive while ensuring a good margin if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 28, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 34, and considering the historical trends in the bids, it is evident that bidding slightly below my value could increase my chances of winning while ensuring a positive margin if I win. The historical data shows that winning bids are often slightly below the perceived value, and second-highest bids often trail reasonably close behind. Thus, I aim for a competitive yet cautious bid of 28 to maximize potential profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 27, and considering the historical trends in the bids, I observe that bidding slightly below my perceived value often remains competitive while maximizing potential profit. Historical bids show that the highest bids are typically close to but not exceeding perceived values, and a bid around 22 should position me well to potentially win while maximizing profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 26. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 37, and considering historical trends where winning bids are often competitive but slightly lower than perceived values, I aim to balance winning the bid and maximizing profit. I noticed from previous rounds that bids close to the mid-to-high twenties often win when perceived values aren\u2019t too high. Bidding 32 should be competitive enough to win while ensuring the second-highest bid allows for a positive profit margin.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 30, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the value of 38 for the prize this round and analyzing the historical bid patterns, I've observed that bids slightly below the perceived value tend to be competitive while still aiming for a positive profit margin. Bidding 33 allows a slight buffer below my perceived value to account for aggressive bidding patterns and ensures that if I win, the second-highest bid will likely result in a profitable outcome.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Based on the history of previous rounds, winning bids and second-highest bids vary significantly. To increase my chances while remaining competitive and maintaining a healthy margin between my bid and the second-highest bid, I will bid 35. This bid is intended to balance the risk and reward effectively.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15.

From previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by around 5-10 units. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning the auction and securing a profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be around or below my bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12.

In previous rounds, bids from others have varied, but bids significantly lower than their perceived values often result in a winning chance without overbidding. By bidding 18, I aim to win while ensuring that I won't risk spending too much compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 30, 18.

In the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by about 5-15 units from the highest bid. Considering the range of bids and aiming for a healthy margin above the second-highest bid, I will bid 30.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 26, and knowing from the history that the bids have varied widely and sometimes went up to as high as 62 in competitive rounds, I need to bid strategically. A bid of 18 gives me a chance to win if the others' perceived values are not as high but still leaves room for a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid is reasonable. This approach balances risk and profit potential while acknowledging that values and bids will vary independently each round.'

In past rounds, the highest bids often exceeded 50 when values were high, but they stayed around the 20-30 range for medium values.

In the past rounds, winning bids have generally been around 70-80 for high perceived values and 20-30 for medium-low values. A bid of 38 is somewhat conservative but competitive, and it gives me a good chance to stay below any higher bids, ensuring I pay less if I win and hence maximize my profit.'

From previous rounds, I've observed that bids have varied widely, usually falling within a competitive range close to perceived values when those values are high.

Historical bids show that the highest bids are typically close to but not exceeding perceived values, and a bid around 22 should position me well to potentially win while maximizing profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 37, and considering historical trends where winning bids are often competitive but slightly lower than perceived values, I aim to balance winning the bid and maximizing profit. I noticed from previous rounds that bids close to the mid-to-high twenties often win when perceived values aren\u2019t too high. Bidding 32 should be competitive enough to win while ensuring the second-highest bid allows for a positive profit margin.'

Bidding 33 allows a slight buffer below my perceived value to account for aggressive bidding patterns and ensures that if I win, the second-highest bid will likely result in a profitable outcome.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 25, 25, 20.

From previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by around 5-10 units. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning the auction and securing a profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be around or below my bid.'

In previous rounds, bids from others have varied, but bids significantly lower than their perceived values often result in a winning chance without overbidding. By bidding 18, I aim to win while ensuring that I won't risk spending too much compared to the second-highest bid.'

In the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by about 5-15 units from the highest bid. Considering the range of bids and aiming for a healthy margin above the second-highest bid, I will bid 30.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value towards the prize is 26, and knowing from the history that the bids have varied widely and sometimes went up to as high as 62 in competitive rounds, I need to bid strategically. A bid of 18 gives me a chance to win if the others' perceived values are not as high but still leaves room for a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid is reasonable.

In past rounds, the highest bids often exceeded 50 when values were high, but they stayed around the 20-30 range for medium values. I will bid 27 to balance competitiveness and potential profit, considering the variability of second-highest bids.'

In the past rounds, winning bids have generally been around 70-80 for high perceived values and 20-30 for medium-low values. A bid of 38 is somewhat conservative but competitive, and it gives me a good chance to stay below any higher bids, ensuring I pay less if I win and hence maximize my profit.'

From previous rounds, I've observed that bids have varied widely, usually falling within a competitive range close to perceived values when those values are high.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 34, and considering the historical trends in the bids, it is evident that bidding slightly below my value could increase my chances of winning while ensuring a positive margin if I win. The historical data shows that winning bids are often slightly below the perceived value, and second-highest bids often trail reasonably close behind. Thus, I aim for a competitive yet cautious bid of 28 to maximize potential profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 27, and considering the historical trends in the bids, I observe that bidding slightly below my perceived value often remains competitive while maximizing potential profit. Historical bids show that the highest bids are typically close to but not exceeding perceived values, and a bid around 22 should position me well to potentially win while maximizing profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 26. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 37, and considering historical trends where winning bids are often competitive but slightly lower than perceived values, I aim to balance winning the bid and maximizing profit. I noticed from previous rounds that bids close to the mid-to-high twenties often win when perceived values aren\u2019t too high. Bidding 32 should be competitive enough to win while ensuring the second-highest bid allows for a positive profit margin.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 30, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the value of 38 for the prize this round and analyzing the historical bid patterns, I've observed that bids slightly below the perceived value tend to be competitive while still aiming for a positive profit margin. Bidding 33 allows a slight buffer below my perceived value to account for aggressive bidding patterns and ensures that if I win, the second-highest bid will likely result in a profitable outcome.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 25, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 34 and analyzing the historical bids, winning bids are often competitive but slightly below perceived values. By bidding 29, I aim to be close enough to the value to enhance winning chances, while leaving a comfortable margin for profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 77, the (true) common value of the prize was 65, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 77, 65, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 77 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 85 for this round and learning from previous rounds, I can see that aggressive but slightly conservative bidding tends to increase the chances of winning while ensuring a profit. Knowing my perceived value of 85 and considering the trends, I aim to bid 77. This bid is lower than my perceived value to maximize potential profit if I win, and it's high enough to outbid others who might be more conservative. Furthermore, it leaves a sufficient margin to account for potentially high second-highest bids, ensuring the outcome remains profitable.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 62 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 79, I want to bid strategically below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit margin if I win. From the history of previous rounds, the highest winning bids have tended to range from 23 to 81, with second-highest bids generally being lower by around 10-20 units. By bidding 65, I increase my chances of winning the auction while maintaining a sufficient margin for profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be lower than my bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for this round, I aim to bid below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit while staying competitive based on past bidding behavior. Previous rounds show that bids from others can range widely, but lower bids often are around 16-20. By bidding 18, I balance the chance of winning the auction and securing a profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid will remain below my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 28, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 49 for this round, I want to strategically bid below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit margin if I win. Based on the history of previous rounds, winning bids and second-highest bids vary significantly. To increase my chances while remaining competitive and maintaining a healthy margin between my bid and the second-highest bid, I will bid 35. This bid is intended to balance the risk and reward effectively.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 22, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17 for this round, I need to bid slightly below my perceived value to ensure a potential profit margin if I win. From previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by around 5-10 units. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning the auction and securing a profit, assuming the second-highest bid will be around or below my bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 32, 26, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 32 and paid 26. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 this round, I will bid 18 to remain competitive while staying below my perceived value to secure a potential profit. In previous rounds, bids from others have varied, but bids significantly lower than their perceived values often result in a winning chance without overbidding. By bidding 18, I aim to win while ensuring that I won't risk spending too much compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 30, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 42 for this round, I aim to maximize my profit while staying under my perceived value. In the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bids have generally been lower by about 5-15 units from the highest bid. Considering the range of bids and aiming for a healthy margin above the second-highest bid, I will bid 30. This strikes a balance between being competitive and not overpaying, which may increase my chances of winning and securing a profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 25, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 33 for this round, I will bid 20 to increase the likelihood of a winning margin while staying below my perceived value. From previous rounds, we notice that successful bids vary widely but typically stay competitively lower than perceived values. Hence, by bidding 20, I balance the prospects of winning the auction and securing a profit if my bid stands relatively favorable.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 65, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 77, 65, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 77 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 80 for this round and learning from previous rounds, I observe that bidding high but strategically below the perceived value can increase my chances of winning while maintaining a sufficient profit margin. Higher bids tend to win, but a bid around 60 can be competitive and still allow for a significant profit if I win while the second-highest bid is reasonably lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 56 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid. By bidding around half of my perceived value, I maintain a higher chance of achieving a positive net profit if I win the auction, which takes as base an estimated midrange common value often drawn in such rounds. This rate considers a competitive yet conservative approach.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 44, I aim to balance between bidding high enough to potentially win and low enough to ensure positive net profit if I win. Considering the history, bids tend to vary widely, with the highest bids in the previous round being 20 and 16. A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 21, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 35, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit. Based on previous rounds, I've observed that the highest bids can vary widely. In Round 0, bids were 9, 7, 20, 16, with the highest being 20, and the second-highest being 7. In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 53, I need to submit a competitive yet conservative bid to maximize my profit. Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17.

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.'

The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 24, I want to bid slightly less to ensure a profit if I win. I would try to outbid at least one or two competitors without exceeding my value too much. Previous rounds indicate that competitive bids typically range lower, so bidding 20 increases my chances while keeping a margin for profit if I pay the second-highest bid.'

Looking at the history, it appears that competitive bids can be somewhat unpredictable, but often lower than my value. Bidding 45 keeps a sizable margin under my perceived value, considering the potential second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round, I want to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to ensure a profit if I win without overbidding significantly. From previous rounds, I have observed a range of bids with the second-highest bids being lower, hence bidding 15 gives me a chance to win and make a profit considering the competition.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 51 for the prize and the historical bids where I observe that highest bids have been quite competitive, I want to place a bid that increases my chances of winning while providing a decent margin under my perceived value to secure profit. Bidding 42 aims to outbid other potential high bids without going too high above the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential in this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for this round, I would like to bid 35. From previous rounds, I've observed that competitive bids can range quite widely, with the highest bids sometimes even undercutting my current value. By bidding 35, I aim to increase my chances of winning while keeping a healthy margin under my value to ensure a positive profit should I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 28 for this round, I want to place a bid that gives me a reasonable chance of winning while ensuring that I maintain a good margin for profit. From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.'

Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid.

In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.'

For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

If I estimate other bidders\u2019 perceived values may be in a similar range due to independent draws, a slightly conservative bid of 16 could still win the prize without overshooting and paying excessively.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value is 58, I should bid just below this value to ensure a higher chance of winning while ensuring a profit if I do not overpay. Based on previous rounds, the bids can vary, and a bid of 49 may balance the winning chance and the risk of overpaying.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 17, I need to consider bidding significantly lower to avoid the risk of overpaying as seen in previous rounds. If the common value and private adjustments are independent each round, other bidders' values could be low too. Bidding 10 provides a balance, enhancing the chances of winning at a lower cost while being cautious of overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 36, I should bid lower to maximize profit while avoiding overpaying. In the previous rounds, the winning bids and payments have shown that bidding close to the perceived value can often lead to negative profit if the second-highest bid is too high. A bid of 25 balances the risk of not bidding too high, while still providing a chance to win if other participants' perceived values are significantly lower.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30.

Round results have shown that high bids tend to lead to lower profits or small losses when the second-highest bid is high. A bid of 30 strikes a balance between ensuring a competitive offer and reducing the risk of overpayment if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 13, and analyzing the patterns from previous rounds, the optimal strategy involves submitting a cautious bid that is well below my perceived value to avoid the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17.

From previous rounds, I've observed that competitive bids can range quite widely, with the highest bids sometimes even undercutting my current value. By bidding 35, I aim to increase my chances of winning while keeping a healthy margin under my value to ensure a positive profit should I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 28 for this round, I want to place a bid that gives me a reasonable chance of winning while ensuring that I maintain a good margin for profit. From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for this round, I want to bid a value that balances the likelihood of winning and the potential for profit, considering the history of bid patterns. Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid. By bidding 28, I position myself to outbid some competitors without exceeding my perceived value too much, thus maximizing the potential for positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for this round, I want to bid competitively to ensure I have a strong chance of winning while still securing a margin of profit in case I win. Based on the history of previous rounds, I've observed that bids vary quite widely, with second-highest bids often being at least a few increments below my bids. By bidding 52, I place myself in a strong position to win against most bids without cutting too deeply into my profit margin. This decision aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid. By bidding around half of my perceived value, I maintain a higher chance of achieving a positive net profit if I win the auction, which takes as base an estimated midrange common value often drawn in such rounds. This rate considers a competitive yet conservative approach.'

Considering the history, bids tend to vary widely, with the highest bids in the previous round being 20 and 16. A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 21, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10.

In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20.

Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.'

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.'

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids have varied significantly, but the highest bids tend to be moderately above half of the perceived values to account for the second-highest bid being relatively lower. Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.'

Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.'

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome.

If I estimate other bidders\u2019 perceived values may be in a similar range due to independent draws, a slightly conservative bid of 16 could still win the prize without overshooting and paying excessively.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value is 58, I should bid just below this value to ensure a higher chance of winning while ensuring a profit if I do not overpay. Based on previous rounds, the bids can vary, and a bid of 49 may balance the winning chance and the risk of overpaying.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 17, I need to consider bidding significantly lower to avoid the risk of overpaying as seen in previous rounds. If the common value and private adjustments are independent each round, other bidders' values could be low too. Bidding 10 provides a balance, enhancing the chances of winning at a lower cost while being cautious of overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 36, I should bid lower to maximize profit while avoiding overpaying. In the previous rounds, the winning bids and payments have shown that bidding close to the perceived value can often lead to negative profit if the second-highest bid is too high. A bid of 25 balances the risk of not bidding too high, while still providing a chance to win if other participants' perceived values are significantly lower.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17.

Round results have shown that high bids tend to lead to lower profits or small losses when the second-highest bid is high. A bid of 30 strikes a balance between ensuring a competitive offer and reducing the risk of overpayment if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 13, and analyzing the patterns from previous rounds, the optimal strategy involves submitting a cautious bid that is well below my perceived value to avoid the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44, and considering the results and strategies from previous rounds, I should place a bid that is significantly below my perceived value to avoid the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, bidding closer to the perceived value without a considerable margin often resulted in negative profits when the second-highest bid was high. Bidding 30 allows me to have a competitive bid while maintaining a cautious approach to minimize potential losses if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36.

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 65, I should place a bid lower than my perceived value to maximize potential profit while having a reasonable chance of winning. In previous rounds, bidding too close to the perceived value often resulted in losses due to high second-highest bids. A bid of 50 balances the possibility of winning the auction and minimizing overpayment, especially since values are redrawn independently each round and other bidders' values can significantly vary.'

It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 53, I need to submit a competitive yet conservative bid to maximize my profit. Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 38, I'll place a bid that balances competitiveness with profit maximization, based on previous rounds' history. Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 in this round, I will place a conservative bid while still being competitive. Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids have varied, but I aim to maximize profit without overbidding excessively. By bidding 13, I ensure that my bid is slightly over half of my perceived value, allowing room to win against cautious bidders while still aiming for a net positive profit considering potential second-highest bids.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 27, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit. Based on the history of previous rounds, bids have varied significantly, but the highest bids tend to be moderately above half of the perceived values to account for the second-highest bid being relatively lower. Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 63, I aim to bid in a range that balances competitiveness and the likelihood of securing a positive net profit. Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 68, I want to bid competitively yet ensure a positive net profit if I win. Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome. Bidding 45 is strategic because it reflects a robust bid above half my perceived value without excessively reducing potential profits. This bid takes into account both the competitive nature of prior rounds and my goal of maximizing profit by balancing risk and reward.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 90, I need to strategically bid to maximize my total profit. Based on the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely, with winning bids often being significantly above half the perceived value but rarely reaching the full perceived value. By bidding 60, I aim to place a competitive bid that stands a strong chance of winning, while leaving room for profit given the dynamics of the second-highest bid. This bid is high enough to reflect serious intent to win but conservative enough to maximize potential earnings after the auction payment.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 10 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round, I want to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to ensure a profit if I win without overbidding significantly. From previous rounds, I have observed a range of bids with the second-highest bids being lower, hence bidding 15 gives me a chance to win and make a profit considering the competition.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 51 for the prize and the historical bids where I observe that highest bids have been quite competitive, I want to place a bid that increases my chances of winning while providing a decent margin under my perceived value to secure profit. Bidding 42 aims to outbid other potential high bids without going too high above the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential in this round.'

From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.'

Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid.

A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.'

In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.'

Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.'

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12.

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids have varied significantly, but the highest bids tend to be moderately above half of the perceived values to account for the second-highest bid being relatively lower. Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.'

Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36.

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome. Bidding 45 is strategic because it reflects a robust bid above half my perceived value without excessively reducing potential profits. This bid takes into account both the competitive nature of prior rounds and my goal of maximizing profit by balancing risk and reward.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50.

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely, with winning bids often being significantly above half the perceived value but rarely reaching the full perceived value. By bidding 60, I aim to place a competitive bid that stands a strong chance of winning, while leaving room for profit given the dynamics of the second-highest bid. This bid is high enough to reflect serious intent to win but conservative enough to maximize potential earnings after the auction payment.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15.

This strategy considers the need to potentially pay the second-highest bid, which may offer a profitable margin if I win.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56, I'll consider a bit lower bid than my perceived value to maximize the chances of a profitable win. Given the previous round's bids (9, 7, 20, and 16), bidding around 64% of my perceived value (36) strikes a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying in case of strong competition.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering previous rounds where the bids varied significantly (ranging from 7 to 49), I will aim to bid around 58% of my perceived value this time, given my value for the prize is 26. This provides a balanced approach to increase my chances of winning without overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have varied quite a bit (ranging from 9 to 49), and the second-highest bids have also shown a significant range. Given that my perceived value for the prize is 35, I will bid around 20, which is approximately 57% of my perceived value. This strategy aims to balance my likelihood of winning with the goal of not overpaying in case of higher competition.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30.

Given my perceived value for the prize is 29, I'll bid around 59% of my value, which aligns with my previous strategy.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the past rounds, I've noticed that the winning and second-highest bids can be significantly different. Given my current perceived value of 21, bidding approximately 57% of it (which is around 12) strikes a balance between increasing my chances of winning and not overpaying. This strategy has been somewhat consistent with my previous bid percentages and should help achieve a profitable outcome if the second-highest bid is well below my own.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28.

Typically, I aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. With a perceived value of 30, a bid of 17 represents approximately 57% of my value which fits well within my strategy to maximize profit.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my historical strategy of bidding between 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning without overpaying, a bid of 36 seems appropriate. This amount represents approximately 58% of my value (62) for this round, aiming to maximize potential profit while remaining competitive.'

Previous rounds have shown significant variation in bids, and aiming for around 54% of my perceived value (roughly 50) represents a strategic balance. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive based on the observed bidding patterns.'

In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 24, I want to bid slightly less to ensure a profit if I win. I would try to outbid at least one or two competitors without exceeding my value too much. Previous rounds indicate that competitive bids typically range lower, so bidding 20 increases my chances while keeping a margin for profit if I pay the second-highest bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 56, I want to bid high enough to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a margin of profit in case I win. Looking at the history, it appears that competitive bids can be somewhat unpredictable, but often lower than my value. Bidding 45 keeps a sizable margin under my perceived value, considering the potential second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round, I want to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to ensure a profit if I win without overbidding significantly. From previous rounds, I have observed a range of bids with the second-highest bids being lower, hence bidding 15 gives me a chance to win and make a profit considering the competition.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 51 for the prize and the historical bids where I observe that highest bids have been quite competitive, I want to place a bid that increases my chances of winning while providing a decent margin under my perceived value to secure profit. Bidding 42 aims to outbid other potential high bids without going too high above the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential in this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for this round, I would like to bid 35. From previous rounds, I've observed that competitive bids can range quite widely, with the highest bids sometimes even undercutting my current value. By bidding 35, I aim to increase my chances of winning while keeping a healthy margin under my value to ensure a positive profit should I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 28 for this round, I want to place a bid that gives me a reasonable chance of winning while ensuring that I maintain a good margin for profit. From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for this round, I want to bid a value that balances the likelihood of winning and the potential for profit, considering the history of bid patterns. Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid. By bidding 28, I position myself to outbid some competitors without exceeding my perceived value too much, thus maximizing the potential for positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for this round, I want to bid competitively to ensure I have a strong chance of winning while still securing a margin of profit in case I win. Based on the history of previous rounds, I've observed that bids vary quite widely, with second-highest bids often being at least a few increments below my bids. By bidding 52, I place myself in a strong position to win against most bids without cutting too deeply into my profit margin. This decision aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 59 for this round, I want to balance the chances of winning with potential profit. Reviewing the past rounds, the highest bids have varied, but often the second-highest bids have been substantially lower. Bidding 49 aims to outbid competitors while remaining significantly below my perceived value, ensuring the chance for a considerable profit margin if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 17.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 92 for this round, I want to place a bid that balances between securing the win and maximizing my profit margin. Looking at the history, competitive bids have generally been much lower than my current value. By bidding 72, I aim to outbid other competitors while leaving a significant margin below my perceived value to ensure a substantial profit if I have to pay the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize of 22 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds, it appears that competitive bids can vary widely but often remain below values like 20 when prizes are of moderate worth. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning with the potential for a positive profit margin, as the second-highest bid will likely be lower, ensuring I maximize my profit if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 7, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14.

I have noticed that often the bids vary widely, but the winning bid isn't always much higher.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid.

A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.'

In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20.

Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.'

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12.

Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.'

Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.'

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome. Bidding 45 is strategic because it reflects a robust bid above half my perceived value without excessively reducing potential profits. This bid takes into account both the competitive nature of prior rounds and my goal of maximizing profit by balancing risk and reward.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50.

By bidding 60, I aim to place a competitive bid that stands a strong chance of winning, while leaving room for profit given the dynamics of the second-highest bid. This bid is high enough to reflect serious intent to win but conservative enough to maximize potential earnings after the auction payment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14, I would aim to bid around 50% of my perceived value to maximize the chances of winning while not overpaying. This strategy considers the need to potentially pay the second-highest bid, which may offer a profitable margin if I win.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56, I'll consider a bit lower bid than my perceived value to maximize the chances of a profitable win. Given the previous round's bids (9, 7, 20, and 16), bidding around 64% of my perceived value (36) strikes a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying in case of strong competition.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering previous rounds where the bids varied significantly (ranging from 7 to 49), I will aim to bid around 58% of my perceived value this time, given my value for the prize is 26. This provides a balanced approach to increase my chances of winning without overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have varied quite a bit (ranging from 9 to 49), and the second-highest bids have also shown a significant range. Given that my perceived value for the prize is 35, I will bid around 20, which is approximately 57% of my perceived value. This strategy aims to balance my likelihood of winning with the goal of not overpaying in case of higher competition.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bid has typically been significantly lower than the highest bid (e.g., 9 and 7, 45 and 49, 15 and 21, 33 and 42). Given my perceived value for the prize is 29, I'll bid around 59% of my value, which aligns with my previous strategy. This approach balances the need to maximize the chances of winning while avoiding overpaying.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the past rounds, I've noticed that the winning and second-highest bids can be significantly different. Given my current perceived value of 21, bidding approximately 57% of it (which is around 12) strikes a balance between increasing my chances of winning and not overpaying. This strategy has been somewhat consistent with my previous bid percentages and should help achieve a profitable outcome if the second-highest bid is well below my own.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the highest and winning bids have varied widely. Typically, I aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. With a perceived value of 30, a bid of 17 represents approximately 57% of my value which fits well within my strategy to maximize profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my history, I generally aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. Given that my perceived value is 64, a bid of 36 represents approximately 56% of my value, fitting within my strategy to potentially maximize profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my historical strategy of bidding between 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning without overpaying, a bid of 36 seems appropriate. This amount represents approximately 58% of my value (62) for this round, aiming to maximize potential profit while remaining competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 92, I am aiming for a bid that balances the likelihood of winning with the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds have shown significant variation in bids, and aiming for around 54% of my perceived value (roughly 50) represents a strategic balance. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive based on the observed bidding patterns.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, I have identified that bidding around 55-60% of my perceived value strikes a good balance between winning the prize and not overpaying. My value for the prize this round is 10, so bidding 6 aligns with this strategy (60% of 10). This approach aims to potentially maximize profit while acknowledging that values and bids vary independently each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 5, I will bid around 60% of my value consistent with my previous strategy to balance the chances of winning while avoiding overpaying.

In the previous rounds, the winning bids and payments have shown that bidding close to the perceived value can often lead to negative profit if the second-highest bid is too high.

In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round, I want to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to ensure a profit if I win without overbidding significantly. From previous rounds, I have observed a range of bids with the second-highest bids being lower, hence bidding 15 gives me a chance to win and make a profit considering the competition.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 51 for the prize and the historical bids where I observe that highest bids have been quite competitive, I want to place a bid that increases my chances of winning while providing a decent margin under my perceived value to secure profit. Bidding 42 aims to outbid other potential high bids without going too high above the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential in this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for this round, I would like to bid 35. From previous rounds, I've observed that competitive bids can range quite widely, with the highest bids sometimes even undercutting my current value. By bidding 35, I aim to increase my chances of winning while keeping a healthy margin under my value to ensure a positive profit should I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 28 for this round, I want to place a bid that gives me a reasonable chance of winning while ensuring that I maintain a good margin for profit. From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for this round, I want to bid a value that balances the likelihood of winning and the potential for profit, considering the history of bid patterns. Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid. By bidding 28, I position myself to outbid some competitors without exceeding my perceived value too much, thus maximizing the potential for positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for this round, I want to bid competitively to ensure I have a strong chance of winning while still securing a margin of profit in case I win. Based on the history of previous rounds, I've observed that bids vary quite widely, with second-highest bids often being at least a few increments below my bids. By bidding 52, I place myself in a strong position to win against most bids without cutting too deeply into my profit margin. This decision aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 59 for this round, I want to balance the chances of winning with potential profit. Reviewing the past rounds, the highest bids have varied, but often the second-highest bids have been substantially lower. Bidding 49 aims to outbid competitors while remaining significantly below my perceived value, ensuring the chance for a considerable profit margin if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 17.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 92 for this round, I want to place a bid that balances between securing the win and maximizing my profit margin. Looking at the history, competitive bids have generally been much lower than my current value. By bidding 72, I aim to outbid other competitors while leaving a significant margin below my perceived value to ensure a substantial profit if I have to pay the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize of 22 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds, it appears that competitive bids can vary widely but often remain below values like 20 when prizes are of moderate worth. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning with the potential for a positive profit margin, as the second-highest bid will likely be lower, ensuring I maximize my profit if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 7, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 7 in this round and considering the history of previous rounds, placing a bid that is lower than my perceived value while remaining competitive is key. I have noticed that often the bids vary widely, but the winning bid isn't always much higher. By bidding 5, I place myself in a position to potentially win without overbidding too much, thus mitigating the risk of a loss while maximizing my profit if the second-highest bid is low.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 58, 53, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, competitive bids often range below my value, suggesting a bid considerably lower than my total value could secure a win while ensuring profit. Bidding 58 optimizes my chances of winning by outbidding others while maintaining a healthy margin below my value to maximize profit if I pay the second-highest bid.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 46 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid.

A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.'

In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.'

To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.'

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.'

Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.'

Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.'

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome. Bidding 45 is strategic because it reflects a robust bid above half my perceived value without excessively reducing potential profits. This bid takes into account both the competitive nature of prior rounds and my goal of maximizing profit by balancing risk and reward.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50.

By bidding 60, I aim to place a competitive bid that stands a strong chance of winning, while leaving room for profit given the dynamics of the second-highest bid. This bid is high enough to reflect serious intent to win but conservative enough to maximize potential earnings after the auction payment.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56, I'll consider a bit lower bid than my perceived value to maximize the chances of a profitable win. Given the previous round's bids (9, 7, 20, and 16), bidding around 64% of my perceived value (36) strikes a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying in case of strong competition.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering previous rounds where the bids varied significantly (ranging from 7 to 49), I will aim to bid around 58% of my perceived value this time, given my value for the prize is 26. This provides a balanced approach to increase my chances of winning without overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have varied quite a bit (ranging from 9 to 49), and the second-highest bids have also shown a significant range. Given that my perceived value for the prize is 35, I will bid around 20, which is approximately 57% of my perceived value. This strategy aims to balance my likelihood of winning with the goal of not overpaying in case of higher competition.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, the second-highest bid has typically been significantly lower than the highest bid (e.g., 9 and 7, 45 and 49, 15 and 21, 33 and 42). Given my perceived value for the prize is 29, I'll bid around 59% of my value, which aligns with my previous strategy. This approach balances the need to maximize the chances of winning while avoiding overpaying.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the past rounds, I've noticed that the winning and second-highest bids can be significantly different. Given my current perceived value of 21, bidding approximately 57% of it (which is around 12) strikes a balance between increasing my chances of winning and not overpaying. This strategy has been somewhat consistent with my previous bid percentages and should help achieve a profitable outcome if the second-highest bid is well below my own.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the highest and winning bids have varied widely. Typically, I aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. With a perceived value of 30, a bid of 17 represents approximately 57% of my value which fits well within my strategy to maximize profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my history, I generally aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. Given that my perceived value is 64, a bid of 36 represents approximately 56% of my value, fitting within my strategy to potentially maximize profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my historical strategy of bidding between 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning without overpaying, a bid of 36 seems appropriate. This amount represents approximately 58% of my value (62) for this round, aiming to maximize potential profit while remaining competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 92, I am aiming for a bid that balances the likelihood of winning with the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds have shown significant variation in bids, and aiming for around 54% of my perceived value (roughly 50) represents a strategic balance. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive based on the observed bidding patterns.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, I have identified that bidding around 55-60% of my perceived value strikes a good balance between winning the prize and not overpaying. My value for the prize this round is 10, so bidding 6 aligns with this strategy (60% of 10). This approach aims to potentially maximize profit while acknowledging that values and bids vary independently each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 5, I will bid around 60% of my value consistent with my previous strategy to balance the chances of winning while avoiding overpaying. This amount equals 3. Although my perceived value is low this round, sticking to my strategy should help maximize potential profit over the long term.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 58, 53, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 71, I'll aim to bid around 56% (approximately 40) of my perceived value. My previous strategy of bidding between 55-60% has balanced the chances of winning with the risk of overpaying. The bidding history shows a variety of bid ranges, and aiming for around 40 keeps me competitive while potentially maximizing profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 45 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

If the common value and private adjustments are independent each round, other bidders' values could be low too.

In the previous rounds, the winning bids and payments have shown that bidding close to the perceived value can often lead to negative profit if the second-highest bid is too high. A bid of 25 balances the risk of not bidding too high, while still providing a chance to win if other participants' perceived values are significantly lower.'

In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.'

Reviewing the history of previous rounds, lower bids tend to provide a better balance between winning the auction and minimizing overpayment.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 56, I want to bid high enough to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a margin of profit in case I win. Looking at the history, it appears that competitive bids can be somewhat unpredictable, but often lower than my value. Bidding 45 keeps a sizable margin under my perceived value, considering the potential second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for the prize this round, I want to bid slightly lower than my perceived value to ensure a profit if I win without overbidding significantly. From previous rounds, I have observed a range of bids with the second-highest bids being lower, hence bidding 15 gives me a chance to win and make a profit considering the competition.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 51 for the prize and the historical bids where I observe that highest bids have been quite competitive, I want to place a bid that increases my chances of winning while providing a decent margin under my perceived value to secure profit. Bidding 42 aims to outbid other potential high bids without going too high above the second-highest bid, optimizing my profit potential in this round.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for this round, I would like to bid 35. From previous rounds, I've observed that competitive bids can range quite widely, with the highest bids sometimes even undercutting my current value. By bidding 35, I aim to increase my chances of winning while keeping a healthy margin under my value to ensure a positive profit should I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 28 for this round, I want to place a bid that gives me a reasonable chance of winning while ensuring that I maintain a good margin for profit. From previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids often vary widely, yet a bid around 20 could strategically position me to win at a second-highest bid that allows for positive profit. This approach aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally under unpredictable conditions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for this round, I want to bid a value that balances the likelihood of winning and the potential for profit, considering the history of bid patterns. Previously, competitive bids have been relatively varied, but often follow a trend where the second-highest bid falls within a reasonable margin below the highest bid. By bidding 28, I position myself to outbid some competitors without exceeding my perceived value too much, thus maximizing the potential for positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for this round, I want to bid competitively to ensure I have a strong chance of winning while still securing a margin of profit in case I win. Based on the history of previous rounds, I've observed that bids vary quite widely, with second-highest bids often being at least a few increments below my bids. By bidding 52, I place myself in a strong position to win against most bids without cutting too deeply into my profit margin. This decision aims to balance risk and potential gain optimally.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 49, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 49, 45, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 59 for this round, I want to balance the chances of winning with potential profit. Reviewing the past rounds, the highest bids have varied, but often the second-highest bids have been substantially lower. Bidding 49 aims to outbid competitors while remaining significantly below my perceived value, ensuring the chance for a considerable profit margin if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 17.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 92 for this round, I want to place a bid that balances between securing the win and maximizing my profit margin. Looking at the history, competitive bids have generally been much lower than my current value. By bidding 72, I aim to outbid other competitors while leaving a significant margin below my perceived value to ensure a substantial profit if I have to pay the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -13.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize of 22 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds, it appears that competitive bids can vary widely but often remain below values like 20 when prizes are of moderate worth. By bidding 15, I balance the chance of winning with the potential for a positive profit margin, as the second-highest bid will likely be lower, ensuring I maximize my profit if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 7, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 7 in this round and considering the history of previous rounds, placing a bid that is lower than my perceived value while remaining competitive is key. I have noticed that often the bids vary widely, but the winning bid isn't always much higher. By bidding 5, I place myself in a position to potentially win without overbidding too much, thus mitigating the risk of a loss while maximizing my profit if the second-highest bid is low.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 58, 53, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, competitive bids often range below my value, suggesting a bid considerably lower than my total value could secure a win while ensuring profit. Bidding 58 optimizes my chances of winning by outbidding others while maintaining a healthy margin below my value to maximize profit if I pay the second-highest bid.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 26, 23, 21. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 26. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for this round, I want to place a bid that maximizes my chances of winning while ensuring a potential profit. Based on the historical patterns observed across previous rounds, competitive bids tend to vary but often range around the middle values. Bidding 35 gives me a good chance of winning by outbidding lower bids while maintaining a significant margin below my perceived value, thus ensuring profitability if I win and pay the second-highest bid.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 77 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Previous rounds have shown various winning strategies where the bid is generally lower than personal value to account for the after-effects of the second-highest bid. By bidding around half of my perceived value, I maintain a higher chance of achieving a positive net profit if I win the auction, which takes as base an estimated midrange common value often drawn in such rounds. This rate considers a competitive yet conservative approach.'

Considering the history, bids tend to vary widely, with the highest bids in the previous round being 20 and 16. A bid of 30 is competitive yet strategic, aiming to outbid others who might consider values in the mid to high range but still less than my total perceived value to ensure profitability after considering the likely second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 21, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 2.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 21, 15, 15, 10.

Based on previous rounds, I've observed that the highest bids can vary widely. In Round 0, bids were 9, 7, 20, 16, with the highest being 20, and the second-highest being 7. In Round 1, bids were 49, 45, 36, 30, with the highest being 49 and the second-highest being 45. A bid of 21 is conservative but competitive. It ensures I don't overbid while still having a chance to win if the bids of others are not excessively high. This way, if I win, I hope to secure a positive profit margin by not paying too high a second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 33, 25, 20.

Looking at previous rounds' winning strategies, the highest bids were 9, 49, and 21, and the second-highest bids were 7, 45, and 15 respectively. To maximize profit, I should bid around two-thirds of my perceived value. This bid is high enough to have a robust chance of winning, while still being conservative enough to account for the potential second-highest bid being significantly lower, thereby ensuring a positive net profit.'

Bids have varied widely, and winners often pay close to the second-highest bid. A bid of 23 is conservative yet competitive, considering past winning bids and the fact that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 20, 13, 12.

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids have varied significantly, but the highest bids tend to be moderately above half of the perceived values to account for the second-highest bid being relatively lower. Bidding 18 provides a balance of being conservative while remaining competitive. This bid, while cautious, aims to maximize potential profit, taking into account the need to avoid overbidding and the behavior observed in past rounds.'

Reviewing previous rounds, the winning bid is often higher than half of the perceived value but should not be too close to the full value to ensure a profit margin. I have noticed that winning bids can be significantly high, and considering the second-highest bid dynamics, a bid of 41 is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit while having a strong chance to win the auction.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 68, I want to bid competitively yet ensure a positive net profit if I win. Previous rounds have shown that winning bids range between the perceived value midpoint and slightly higher, but careful analysis shows the second-highest bid often determines the winner's net profit outcome. Bidding 45 is strategic because it reflects a robust bid above half my perceived value without excessively reducing potential profits. This bid takes into account both the competitive nature of prior rounds and my goal of maximizing profit by balancing risk and reward.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50.

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely, with winning bids often being significantly above half the perceived value but rarely reaching the full perceived value. By bidding 60, I aim to place a competitive bid that stands a strong chance of winning, while leaving room for profit given the dynamics of the second-highest bid. This bid is high enough to reflect serious intent to win but conservative enough to maximize potential earnings after the auction payment.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15.

Looking at previous rounds, a bid slightly below half of my value has a chance to win, especially since second-highest bids can fluctuate widely. Bidding 7 is strategic as it reflects caution, minimizes potential losses, and aligns with the observed behaviors of winning lower bids in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14, I would aim to bid around 50% of my perceived value to maximize the chances of winning while not overpaying. This strategy considers the need to potentially pay the second-highest bid, which may offer a profitable margin if I win.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 36, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56, I'll consider a bit lower bid than my perceived value to maximize the chances of a profitable win. Given the previous round's bids (9, 7, 20, and 16), bidding around 64% of my perceived value (36) strikes a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying in case of strong competition.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 21 and paid 15. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering previous rounds where the bids varied significantly (ranging from 7 to 49), I will aim to bid around 58% of my perceived value this time, given my value for the prize is 26. This provides a balanced approach to increase my chances of winning without overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 33. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have varied quite a bit (ranging from 9 to 49), and the second-highest bids have also shown a significant range. Given that my perceived value for the prize is 35, I will bid around 20, which is approximately 57% of my perceived value. This strategy aims to balance my likelihood of winning with the goal of not overpaying in case of higher competition.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 25, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 30, 23, 17.

Given my perceived value for the prize is 29, I'll bid around 59% of my value, which aligns with my previous strategy.

The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the past rounds, I've noticed that the winning and second-highest bids can be significantly different. Given my current perceived value of 21, bidding approximately 57% of it (which is around 12) strikes a balance between increasing my chances of winning and not overpaying. This strategy has been somewhat consistent with my previous bid percentages and should help achieve a profitable outcome if the second-highest bid is well below my own.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the history of previous rounds, the highest and winning bids have varied widely. Typically, I aim to bid around 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning against the risk of overpaying. With a perceived value of 30, a bid of 17 represents approximately 57% of my value which fits well within my strategy to maximize profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 49. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my historical strategy of bidding between 55-60% of my perceived value to balance the chances of winning without overpaying, a bid of 36 seems appropriate. This amount represents approximately 58% of my value (62) for this round, aiming to maximize potential profit while remaining competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 60, 60, 50.

The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 92, I am aiming for a bid that balances the likelihood of winning with the risk of overpaying. Previous rounds have shown significant variation in bids, and aiming for around 54% of my perceived value (roughly 50) represents a strategic balance. This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive based on the observed bidding patterns.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 2, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, I have identified that bidding around 55-60% of my perceived value strikes a good balance between winning the prize and not overpaying. My value for the prize this round is 10, so bidding 6 aligns with this strategy (60% of 10). This approach aims to potentially maximize profit while acknowledging that values and bids vary independently each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 5, you bid 3, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 5, I will bid around 60% of my value consistent with my previous strategy to balance the chances of winning while avoiding overpaying. This amount equals 3. Although my perceived value is low this round, sticking to my strategy should help maximize potential profit over the long term.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 58, 53, 40.

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 71, I'll aim to bid around 56% (approximately 40) of my perceived value. My previous strategy of bidding between 55-60% has balanced the chances of winning with the risk of overpaying. The bidding history shows a variety of bid ranges, and aiming for around 40 keeps me competitive while potentially maximizing profit.'

In the previous rounds, the winning bids and payments have shown that bidding close to the perceived value can often lead to negative profit if the second-highest bid is too high.

In previous rounds, bidding higher has often resulted in little to no profit or even losses. Since the common value and the bids of other participants fluctuate, a bid of 7 provides a better balance, offering a reasonable chance to win without significant risk of negative profit if I do not win.'

Reviewing the history of previous rounds, lower bids tend to provide a better balance between winning the auction and minimizing overpayment.

Reviewing the previous rounds, higher bids often result in winning the auction but at the cost of reduced or negative profits due to the second-highest bids. A bid around 68 strategically positions me higher than the likely average bids while ensuring I don't overpay if I win the auction, thereby maximizing my expected profit.'

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 40', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 15, bidding too high might not be profitable if someone else values the prize significantly more. A bid slightly over half of my value, say 8, allows a balance between potentially winning the prize and not overpaying in case of a close bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 41, I want to make a competitive bid without overpaying significantly. From the previous round's history, bids ranged between 8 and 20. Setting a bid at 30 places me in a strong position to win while still leaving room for a reasonable profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within the previous observed range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, it seems the range of bids varies significantly. In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win. This aligns with the reasoning from the second round where a high bid ensured winning but not too far above the second-highest bid for profitability.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 40 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

By placing a bid of 8, I balance the risk of overbidding with the potential to still secure the prize at a profitable margin. This approach considers the uncertainty in other bidders' values and aims to maximize my profit over multiple rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 28, I need to place a bid that ensures a profit margin while taking into account the uncertainty of other bidders' values and bids. In the previous round, the bids were relatively spread out with a maximum bid of 20. Assuming a similar spread, a bid of 18 is aggressive enough to potentially win the auction but leaves room for a profit if the second-highest bid is below 28.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 42, I need to place a bid that balances the potential for winning the auction with the risk of overbidding. In previous rounds, bids have been spread out with winners often bidding higher amounts and paying near their bid. To maximize my profit, I aim to place a bid that is aggressive enough to win yet leaves room for a profit with a second-highest bid potentially around 28-30, leading to profitable scenarios.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I need to place a bid that balances the probability of winning with the potential for profit. Previous rounds show that bids have been relatively spread out, with winning bids often significantly higher than the second-highest. By bidding 40, I am aggressive enough to increase my chances of winning, while still aiming to pay less than my perceived value, based on previous patterns where second-highest bids have been lower.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 18, I need to place a bid that gives me a chance to win while maintaining a positive profit margin. In previous rounds, bids have been significantly dispersed, with the second-highest bids typically trailing the highest bids by a noticeable margin. By bidding 10, I aim to secure the prize at a cost lower than my value, based on observed bidding patterns, and maximize my expected profit considering the uncertainty of other bidders' values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 10 and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, I will place a conservative bid. Previous rounds have shown that the winning bid is often significantly higher than the perceived values, and overbidding has led to negative profits. By bidding 5, I minimize my risk of losing money if I win, while still giving myself a modest chance at securing the prize if other bidders undervalue it.'

In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win.

In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.'

From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment.

From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.'

In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic.

From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35.

Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s.

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while still having a shot at potentially winning. From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In previous rounds, bids have been spread out with winners often bidding higher amounts and paying near their bid. To maximize my profit, I aim to place a bid that is aggressive enough to win yet leaves room for a profit with a second-highest bid potentially around 28-30, leading to profitable scenarios.'

Previous rounds show that bids have been relatively spread out, with winning bids often significantly higher than the second-highest.

In previous rounds, bids have been significantly dispersed, with the second-highest bids typically trailing the highest bids by a noticeable margin.

Previous rounds have shown that the winning bid is often significantly higher than the perceived values, and overbidding has led to negative profits. By bidding 5, I minimize my risk of losing money if I win, while still giving myself a modest chance at securing the prize if other bidders undervalue it.'

Previous rounds show winning bids often exceed perceived values, but bidding slightly lower can still secure wins based on second-highest bids. A bid of 15 is conservative enough to avoid overpaying while still giving me a chance at winning if other bids are lower.'

In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win.

In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.'

From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.'

In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15.

From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.'

Looking at previous rounds, higher perceived values tend to attract higher bids, and the second-highest bids are often significantly lower than the highest bids.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 52, I want to bid below it to ensure a margin for profit. Analyzing the previous rounds' bids, the highest bid has been 30 and 28. To maximize my chances of winning while still securing a potential profit, I will bid 45, which is competitively higher than the previous highest bids but still below my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 57, I aim to bid slightly lower to ensure a margin for profit while still having a competitive edge. Analyzing past rounds, the highest winning bid was 45. To maximize my chances of winning while ensuring potential profit, bidding 50 seems balanced as it's competitively higher than past winning bids but still below my perceived value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 16, I want to bid below it to ensure a margin for profit. Analyzing past rounds, bidders tend to bid under their perceived values but stay competitive. In previous rounds, bids have ranged from 8 to 50. To maximize my chances of winning while having a safety margin for profit, bidding 12 seems prudent and competitive enough.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 17 for this round, I must bid below this to ensure a margin for profit. Past bids have shown tendencies to bid under perceived values but still stay competitive, often within a range below 20 for lower values. Bidding 14 keeps me competitive while giving a good margin for profit if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 and analyzing past bidding behavior, I should aim to bid below my value to ensure a margin for profit while staying competitive. Previous rounds show a tendency for bids to range from 5 to 50 depending on values. Considering that my value is on the lower side, a bid of 16 keeps me competitive while providing a reasonable margin for potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 49 for this round, I want to bid below it to ensure a margin for profit. Learning from previous rounds, the highest winning bids have been slightly below their perceived values, and taking into account that my perceived value is higher than usual, bidding 42 keeps me competitive while providing a reasonable margin for potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 20 for this round, I aim to maximize my profit while strategically bidding to increase my chances of winning the auction. Analyzing previous rounds, bidders generally place their bids slightly below their perceived values but tend to be competitive. Considering the spread of previous bids and outcomes, bidding 15 ensures a reasonable balance between staying competitive and allowing for a margin of profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -22. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23.

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29 and I need to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win, I will bid conservatively. Bidding 20 reduces my risk of overpaying in case the second-highest bid is near my own value. This ensures I have a chance for a positive net profit if successful.'

Based on the history of the previous round, where the highest bid beyond mine was 19, I'll bid slightly lower to reduce my risk of overpaying while still being competitive.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 43, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win while being cautious of the second-highest bid. Past rounds indicate relatively high bids from competitors, with second-highest bids around 19 and 28.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, I need to strategically balance my bid to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if I win. From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35.

From the history, we observe that winning bids vary significantly, with second-highest bids typically around the mid-20s or lower. Given I have a relatively low perceived value this round, I will place a conservative bid of 10 to minimize risk and potential loss, aiming to avoid winning with a high-cost bid as my potential gain is limited.'

Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and considering the history of previous rounds where bids have varied widely, I will place a conservative bid of 10. This is to minimize potential losses because my perceived value is relatively low in comparison to previous rounds. By bidding lower, I aim to remain competitive without risking too much, as the chances of winning with higher bids in the past have generally resulted in minimal profit or even a loss.'

Looking at the history, previous highest successful bids have been quite varied but are often in the range of the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 30, I aim to remain competitive without bidding too high, which would reduce my profit margin. My goal is to balance between securing the prize and ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful.'

From the history, I've seen that successful second-highest bids often fall into the mid to high teens. Bidding 15 places me competitively without overextending in case others bid higher. This strategy aims to balance between winning the auction at a reasonable price and ensuring a net profit if I win.'

The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 19, I should place a bid that balances the probability of winning with the potential for profit. Previous rounds show winning bids often exceed perceived values, but bidding slightly lower can still secure wins based on second-highest bids. A bid of 15 is conservative enough to avoid overpaying while still giving me a chance at winning if other bids are lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 45 and the history of previous rounds, where bids have varied widely and the second-highest bids have generally trailed the winning bid by a considerable margin, a bid of 35 strikes a balance between increasing my chances of winning and avoiding overbidding. By bidding 35, I have a good probability of securing the prize without risking too high of a payment, maximizing my expected profit.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 27 and considering the history of previous rounds, bids have varied significantly with the second-highest bids often being noticeably lower. By bidding 20, I aim to balance between securing a win and avoiding overbidding, leaving room for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 15, bidding too high might not be profitable if someone else values the prize significantly more. A bid slightly over half of my value, say 8, allows a balance between potentially winning the prize and not overpaying in case of a close bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 41, I want to make a competitive bid without overpaying significantly. From the previous round's history, bids ranged between 8 and 20. Setting a bid at 30 places me in a strong position to win while still leaving room for a reasonable profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within the previous observed range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, it seems the range of bids varies significantly. In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win. This aligns with the reasoning from the second round where a high bid ensured winning but not too far above the second-highest bid for profitability.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while still having a shot at potentially winning. From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 34, I need to bid strategically to balance the chances of winning with minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at previous rounds, higher perceived values tend to attract higher bids, and the second-highest bids are often significantly lower than the highest bids. Consequently, a bid of 23 should be competitive enough to win against potentially lower bids while leaving a margin for profit if I win and the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10.

From the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely with higher perceived values leading to higher bids.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29 and I need to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win, I will bid conservatively. Bidding 20 reduces my risk of overpaying in case the second-highest bid is near my own value. This ensures I have a chance for a positive net profit if successful.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win and to avoid overbidding. Based on the history of the previous round, where the highest bid beyond mine was 19, I'll bid slightly lower to reduce my risk of overpaying while still being competitive. Thus, 15 is a more conservative bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 43, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win while being cautious of the second-highest bid. Past rounds indicate relatively high bids from competitors, with second-highest bids around 19 and 28. By bidding 23, I aim to balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful. This is a calculated attempt to outbid lower bids while staying under the highest aggressive bids of competitors.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, I need to strategically balance my bid to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if I win. From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35. This should position me well against potential high bids while keeping the second-highest bid in consideration, aiming for a positive net profit.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15 in this round, I need to bid strategically to avoid unnecessary losses. From the history, we observe that winning bids vary significantly, with second-highest bids typically around the mid-20s or lower. Given I have a relatively low perceived value this round, I will place a conservative bid of 10 to minimize risk and potential loss, aiming to avoid winning with a high-cost bid as my potential gain is limited.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22, I need to bid conservatively to ensure a profit if I win while avoiding overbidding. Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s. By bidding 10, I aim to stay competitive but also minimize potential losses, as the prize value in this round is relatively low.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and considering the history of previous rounds where bids have varied widely, I will place a conservative bid of 10. This is to minimize potential losses because my perceived value is relatively low in comparison to previous rounds. By bidding lower, I aim to remain competitive without risking too much, as the chances of winning with higher bids in the past have generally resulted in minimal profit or even a loss.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I want to bid strategically to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at the history, previous highest successful bids have been quite varied but are often in the range of the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 30, I aim to remain competitive without bidding too high, which would reduce my profit margin. My goal is to balance between securing the prize and ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I will bid 15 to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, I've seen that successful second-highest bids often fall into the mid to high teens. Bidding 15 places me competitively without overextending in case others bid higher. This strategy aims to balance between winning the auction at a reasonable price and ensuring a net profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to bid strategically to have a high chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, we have observed high bids but frequent second-highest bids in the range of mid-20s to low-40s. By bidding 32, I position myself to potentially outbid lower or moderately competitive bids while still maintaining a buffer against overpaying, aiming to secure a positive net profit if I win.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 and observing the history of previous rounds, it's crucial to bid conservatively to minimize potential losses. In past rounds, lower bids have often been successful, and bids around the mid-teens or lower often minimize the risk of overpaying.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 15, bidding too high might not be profitable if someone else values the prize significantly more. A bid slightly over half of my value, say 8, allows a balance between potentially winning the prize and not overpaying in case of a close bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 41, I want to make a competitive bid without overpaying significantly. From the previous round's history, bids ranged between 8 and 20. Setting a bid at 30 places me in a strong position to win while still leaving room for a reasonable profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within the previous observed range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, it seems the range of bids varies significantly. In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win. This aligns with the reasoning from the second round where a high bid ensured winning but not too far above the second-highest bid for profitability.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while still having a shot at potentially winning. From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 34, I need to bid strategically to balance the chances of winning with minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at previous rounds, higher perceived values tend to attract higher bids, and the second-highest bids are often significantly lower than the highest bids. Consequently, a bid of 23 should be competitive enough to win against potentially lower bids while leaving a margin for profit if I win and the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. From the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely with higher perceived values leading to higher bids. Considering my lower value this round, I will bid slightly over half my perceived value, which aligns with strategies from rounds with similar values, aiming to strike a balance between competitiveness and risk. Therefore, I choose to bid 8.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 75, I need to make a competitive bid to maximize my chance of winning while not overpaying excessively. From past rounds, second-highest bids have often been significantly lower than the highest bids. A bid around 60 positions me strongly to win while still leaving a reasonable margin for profit if the second-highest bid is not too far off from previous trends.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 36 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 33', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 20, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29 and I need to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win, I will bid conservatively. Bidding 20 reduces my risk of overpaying in case the second-highest bid is near my own value. This ensures I have a chance for a positive net profit if successful.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win and to avoid overbidding. Based on the history of the previous round, where the highest bid beyond mine was 19, I'll bid slightly lower to reduce my risk of overpaying while still being competitive. Thus, 15 is a more conservative bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 43, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win while being cautious of the second-highest bid. Past rounds indicate relatively high bids from competitors, with second-highest bids around 19 and 28. By bidding 23, I aim to balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful. This is a calculated attempt to outbid lower bids while staying under the highest aggressive bids of competitors.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, I need to strategically balance my bid to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if I win. From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35. This should position me well against potential high bids while keeping the second-highest bid in consideration, aiming for a positive net profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15 in this round, I need to bid strategically to avoid unnecessary losses. From the history, we observe that winning bids vary significantly, with second-highest bids typically around the mid-20s or lower. Given I have a relatively low perceived value this round, I will place a conservative bid of 10 to minimize risk and potential loss, aiming to avoid winning with a high-cost bid as my potential gain is limited.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22, I need to bid conservatively to ensure a profit if I win while avoiding overbidding. Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s. By bidding 10, I aim to stay competitive but also minimize potential losses, as the prize value in this round is relatively low.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and considering the history of previous rounds where bids have varied widely, I will place a conservative bid of 10. This is to minimize potential losses because my perceived value is relatively low in comparison to previous rounds. By bidding lower, I aim to remain competitive without risking too much, as the chances of winning with higher bids in the past have generally resulted in minimal profit or even a loss.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I want to bid strategically to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at the history, previous highest successful bids have been quite varied but are often in the range of the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 30, I aim to remain competitive without bidding too high, which would reduce my profit margin. My goal is to balance between securing the prize and ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I will bid 15 to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, I've seen that successful second-highest bids often fall into the mid to high teens. Bidding 15 places me competitively without overextending in case others bid higher. This strategy aims to balance between winning the auction at a reasonable price and ensuring a net profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to bid strategically to have a high chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, we have observed high bids but frequent second-highest bids in the range of mid-20s to low-40s. By bidding 32, I position myself to potentially outbid lower or moderately competitive bids while still maintaining a buffer against overpaying, aiming to secure a positive net profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 and observing the history of previous rounds, it's crucial to bid conservatively to minimize potential losses. In past rounds, lower bids have often been successful, and bids around the mid-teens or lower often minimize the risk of overpaying. Therefore, I will bid 10 to stay competitive while reducing the risk of a negative net profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I want to bid strategically to maximize my profit potential while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observing the history, high bids have typically been around 40-50, and the second-highest bids are usually in the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning while ensuring a considerable profit margin if the second-highest bid is within the typical range. This approach aims to balance between winning the auction and securing a positive net profit based on my high perceived value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 33 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 15, bidding too high might not be profitable if someone else values the prize significantly more. A bid slightly over half of my value, say 8, allows a balance between potentially winning the prize and not overpaying in case of a close bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 41, I want to make a competitive bid without overpaying significantly. From the previous round's history, bids ranged between 8 and 20. Setting a bid at 30 places me in a strong position to win while still leaving room for a reasonable profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within the previous observed range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, it seems the range of bids varies significantly. In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win. This aligns with the reasoning from the second round where a high bid ensured winning but not too far above the second-highest bid for profitability.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while still having a shot at potentially winning. From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 34, I need to bid strategically to balance the chances of winning with minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at previous rounds, higher perceived values tend to attract higher bids, and the second-highest bids are often significantly lower than the highest bids. Consequently, a bid of 23 should be competitive enough to win against potentially lower bids while leaving a margin for profit if I win and the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. From the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely with higher perceived values leading to higher bids. Considering my lower value this round, I will bid slightly over half my perceived value, which aligns with strategies from rounds with similar values, aiming to strike a balance between competitiveness and risk. Therefore, I choose to bid 8.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 75, I need to make a competitive bid to maximize my chance of winning while not overpaying excessively. From past rounds, second-highest bids have often been significantly lower than the highest bids. A bid around 60 positions me strongly to win while still leaving a reasonable margin for profit if the second-highest bid is not too far off from previous trends.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 36, 25, 20.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36, I need to consider previous bidding behaviors to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From my history, successful bids generally stay competitive by being lower than their total value but higher than typical second-highest bids. Bids have ranged variably based on perceived values, often between approximately 8 and 60, with higher perceived values leading to higher bids. Keeping my total value in mind, a bid of 25 places me competitively without overcommitting beyond a comfortable margin considering no direct correlation to the previous values and bid trends.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 79 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29 and I need to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win, I will bid conservatively. Bidding 20 reduces my risk of overpaying in case the second-highest bid is near my own value. This ensures I have a chance for a positive net profit if successful.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win and to avoid overbidding. Based on the history of the previous round, where the highest bid beyond mine was 19, I'll bid slightly lower to reduce my risk of overpaying while still being competitive. Thus, 15 is a more conservative bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 43, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win while being cautious of the second-highest bid. Past rounds indicate relatively high bids from competitors, with second-highest bids around 19 and 28. By bidding 23, I aim to balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful. This is a calculated attempt to outbid lower bids while staying under the highest aggressive bids of competitors.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, I need to strategically balance my bid to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if I win. From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35. This should position me well against potential high bids while keeping the second-highest bid in consideration, aiming for a positive net profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15 in this round, I need to bid strategically to avoid unnecessary losses. From the history, we observe that winning bids vary significantly, with second-highest bids typically around the mid-20s or lower. Given I have a relatively low perceived value this round, I will place a conservative bid of 10 to minimize risk and potential loss, aiming to avoid winning with a high-cost bid as my potential gain is limited.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22, I need to bid conservatively to ensure a profit if I win while avoiding overbidding. Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s. By bidding 10, I aim to stay competitive but also minimize potential losses, as the prize value in this round is relatively low.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and considering the history of previous rounds where bids have varied widely, I will place a conservative bid of 10. This is to minimize potential losses because my perceived value is relatively low in comparison to previous rounds. By bidding lower, I aim to remain competitive without risking too much, as the chances of winning with higher bids in the past have generally resulted in minimal profit or even a loss.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I want to bid strategically to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at the history, previous highest successful bids have been quite varied but are often in the range of the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 30, I aim to remain competitive without bidding too high, which would reduce my profit margin. My goal is to balance between securing the prize and ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I will bid 15 to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, I've seen that successful second-highest bids often fall into the mid to high teens. Bidding 15 places me competitively without overextending in case others bid higher. This strategy aims to balance between winning the auction at a reasonable price and ensuring a net profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to bid strategically to have a high chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, we have observed high bids but frequent second-highest bids in the range of mid-20s to low-40s. By bidding 32, I position myself to potentially outbid lower or moderately competitive bids while still maintaining a buffer against overpaying, aiming to secure a positive net profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 and observing the history of previous rounds, it's crucial to bid conservatively to minimize potential losses. In past rounds, lower bids have often been successful, and bids around the mid-teens or lower often minimize the risk of overpaying. Therefore, I will bid 10 to stay competitive while reducing the risk of a negative net profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I want to bid strategically to maximize my profit potential while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observing the history, high bids have typically been around 40-50, and the second-highest bids are usually in the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning while ensuring a considerable profit margin if the second-highest bid is within the typical range. This approach aims to balance between winning the auction and securing a positive net profit based on my high perceived value.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 36, 25, 20.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 15, bidding too high might not be profitable if someone else values the prize significantly more. A bid slightly over half of my value, say 8, allows a balance between potentially winning the prize and not overpaying in case of a close bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 41, I want to make a competitive bid without overpaying significantly. From the previous round's history, bids ranged between 8 and 20. Setting a bid at 30 places me in a strong position to win while still leaving room for a reasonable profit margin if the second-highest bid falls within the previous observed range.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, it seems the range of bids varies significantly. In the first round, bids were between 8 and 20. In the second round, bids were between 15 and 30. Given my value is 48, I will bid 36 to be competitive while ensuring I don\u2019t overpay excessively if I win. This aligns with the reasoning from the second round where a high bid ensured winning but not too far above the second-highest bid for profitability.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 56, I need to make sure that my bid maximizes the chance of winning without overpaying excessively. In previous rounds, the second-highest bid has often been significantly lower than the highest bid. Considering this, a bid in the lower 40s, like 42, should position me well to win while keeping the risk of overpayment manageable.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 23, I need to balance between winning the auction and not overpaying. From previous rounds, I have observed that bids were often quite high, especially when perceived values were higher. A bid of 16 is strategic as it gives me a chance to win competitively against lower bids while minimizing the risk of an overpayment. This is considering my perceived value is relatively low this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 8 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. From the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high. In this situation, with a low value, bidding close to half of my perceived value, such as 5, allows me to stay competitive without risking significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I need to balance the desire to win the auction with the risk of overpaying. In previous rounds, the winning bids varied significantly with higher perceived values generally leading to higher bids. Since my perceived value is 18, lower than previous high bids, a bid of 11 is strategic. It places me competitively while taking into account my lower value this round, aiming to avoid overpayment and maximize potential profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 40, I need to bid strategically to maximize my chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Examining the previous rounds, I noticed that bids tend to be somewhat conservative when perceived values are close to mine. Bids around 28 align with my strategy of remaining competitive while aiming for profitability, as second-highest bids have typically been somewhat lower, allowing a margin for profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while still having a shot at potentially winning. From the history, bids vary widely depending on perceived values. In rounds with lower values, bids around half the value seem more strategic. Hence, with a perceived value of 13, a bid of 6 aims to balance competitiveness and risk, minimizing the chance of significant losses.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 34, I need to bid strategically to balance the chances of winning with minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at previous rounds, higher perceived values tend to attract higher bids, and the second-highest bids are often significantly lower than the highest bids. Consequently, a bid of 23 should be competitive enough to win against potentially lower bids while leaving a margin for profit if I win and the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 13 this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. From the history of previous rounds, bids tend to vary widely with higher perceived values leading to higher bids. Considering my lower value this round, I will bid slightly over half my perceived value, which aligns with strategies from rounds with similar values, aiming to strike a balance between competitiveness and risk. Therefore, I choose to bid 8.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 75, I need to make a competitive bid to maximize my chance of winning while not overpaying excessively. From past rounds, second-highest bids have often been significantly lower than the highest bids. A bid around 60 positions me strongly to win while still leaving a reasonable margin for profit if the second-highest bid is not too far off from previous trends.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 36, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36, I need to consider previous bidding behaviors to maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From my history, successful bids generally stay competitive by being lower than their total value but higher than typical second-highest bids. Bids have ranged variably based on perceived values, often between approximately 8 and 60, with higher perceived values leading to higher bids. Keeping my total value in mind, a bid of 25 places me competitively without overcommitting beyond a comfortable margin considering no direct correlation to the previous values and bid trends.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 60, 55, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 79 for the prize, I need to bid competitively to increase my chances of winning without overpaying excessively. Historically, bids have shown a tendency where the highest bid has often been significantly more than the second-highest bid. Based on previous rounds, where my similar and lower perceived values garnered bids ranging from the low 20s to 60s, a bid of 60 should strategically position me to maximize profit while aligning with previous successful bidding behaviors observed.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29 and I need to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win, I will bid conservatively. Bidding 20 reduces my risk of overpaying in case the second-highest bid is near my own value. This ensures I have a chance for a positive net profit if successful.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 18, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win and to avoid overbidding. Based on the history of the previous round, where the highest bid beyond mine was 19, I'll bid slightly lower to reduce my risk of overpaying while still being competitive. Thus, 15 is a more conservative bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 23, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 36, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 36. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 43, I want to bid strategically to ensure a profit if I win while being cautious of the second-highest bid. Past rounds indicate relatively high bids from competitors, with second-highest bids around 19 and 28. By bidding 23, I aim to balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful. This is a calculated attempt to outbid lower bids while staying under the highest aggressive bids of competitors.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 42, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, I need to strategically balance my bid to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if I win. From the history, we observe that past winning bids have been 30, 45, and around the mid-20s. To be competitive and have a higher chance of winning, I will bid 35. This should position me well against potential high bids while keeping the second-highest bid in consideration, aiming for a positive net profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 12, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 12. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15 in this round, I need to bid strategically to avoid unnecessary losses. From the history, we observe that winning bids vary significantly, with second-highest bids typically around the mid-20s or lower. Given I have a relatively low perceived value this round, I will place a conservative bid of 10 to minimize risk and potential loss, aiming to avoid winning with a high-cost bid as my potential gain is limited.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 22, I need to bid conservatively to ensure a profit if I win while avoiding overbidding. Previous rounds suggest that competitors' second-highest bids can vary significantly, often around the mid-10s to mid-20s. By bidding 10, I aim to stay competitive but also minimize potential losses, as the prize value in this round is relatively low.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 16, 15, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 16 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and considering the history of previous rounds where bids have varied widely, I will place a conservative bid of 10. This is to minimize potential losses because my perceived value is relatively low in comparison to previous rounds. By bidding lower, I aim to remain competitive without risking too much, as the chances of winning with higher bids in the past have generally resulted in minimal profit or even a loss.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 46, 42, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 46 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I want to bid strategically to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Looking at the history, previous highest successful bids have been quite varied but are often in the range of the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 30, I aim to remain competitive without bidding too high, which would reduce my profit margin. My goal is to balance between securing the prize and ensuring a reasonable net profit if successful.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 15, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I will bid 15 to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, I've seen that successful second-highest bids often fall into the mid to high teens. Bidding 15 places me competitively without overextending in case others bid higher. This strategy aims to balance between winning the auction at a reasonable price and ensuring a net profit if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 35, 32, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 46, I aim to bid strategically to have a high chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. From the history, we have observed high bids but frequent second-highest bids in the range of mid-20s to low-40s. By bidding 32, I position myself to potentially outbid lower or moderately competitive bids while still maintaining a buffer against overpaying, aiming to secure a positive net profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 13, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 and observing the history of previous rounds, it's crucial to bid conservatively to minimize potential losses. In past rounds, lower bids have often been successful, and bids around the mid-teens or lower often minimize the risk of overpaying. Therefore, I will bid 10 to stay competitive while reducing the risk of a negative net profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 70, 60, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I want to bid strategically to maximize my profit potential while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observing the history, high bids have typically been around 40-50, and the second-highest bids are usually in the mid-30s to mid-40s. By bidding 55, I increase my chances of winning while ensuring a considerable profit margin if the second-highest bid is within the typical range. This approach aims to balance between winning the auction and securing a positive net profit based on my high perceived value.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 36, 25, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 33 and considering the history of previous rounds, I need to bid in a way that increases my chances of winning while minimizing the risk of overpayment and ensuring a potential profit. In many cases, second-highest bids have been in the low to mid-20s. By bidding 20, I aim to outbid lower bids and stay competitive without overextending, thereby maximizing my potential profit if I win.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 60, 55, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 68, I will bid 50 to balance my competitive position and manage the risk of overpaying. Historically, high bids have varied significantly but typically ranged in the mid-30s to high-40s. By bidding 50, I aim to outbid lower and moderately competitive bids while still leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is within the observed range. This strategy seeks to maximize my chances of winning the prize with a net profit based on my high perceived value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 63 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 4 and considering the bidding history from previous rounds where bids were significantly higher than the low value I currently have, it is highly unlikely that I will win with a low-value bid. Bidding 3 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, and it minimizes potential losses.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 22, 2, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for this round, and based on the bidding patterns in previous rounds where bids have often been close to or above perceived values of the prizes, I choose to bid slightly lower than my perceived value. This strategy helps ensure I don't overpay and allows room for a durable profit if my bid is the highest or second-highest. Analyzing past bids, such as 9, 3, 10, 1 in round 2, shows competitiveness where lower values can still bring strategic advantage.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In evaluating my perceived value of 35 and considering previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or above their perceived values. For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit.

The previous bids had a range where the winning bids were often significantly higher. A bid of 20 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, maximizing my chances for a positive return if I win.'

A bid of 47 positions me well to win without going too close to my perceived value, allowing for a potentially good margin for profit if the second-highest bid is lower but still competitive.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 71, I want to bid strategically considering past rounds. The winning bids and the second-highest bids fluctuated, but often the highest bids are realistic given the perceived value. Even though the second-highest bid tends to be significant, bidding moderately high, 58, balances the competitiveness with a chance of securing a good profit margin if I win.'

Taking into account that in the last round, bids were 45, 44, 38, and 32, bidding 45 this round keeps me competitive but avoids overpaying.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 4 and considering the bidding history from previous rounds where bids were significantly higher than the low value I currently have, it is highly unlikely that I will win with a low-value bid. Bidding 3 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, and it minimizes potential losses.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 22, 2, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for this round, and based on the bidding patterns in previous rounds where bids have often been close to or above perceived values of the prizes, I choose to bid slightly lower than my perceived value. This strategy helps ensure I don't overpay and allows room for a durable profit if my bid is the highest or second-highest. Analyzing past bids, such as 9, 3, 10, 1 in round 2, shows competitiveness where lower values can still bring strategic advantage.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In evaluating my perceived value of 35 and considering previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or above their perceived values. For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. This approach aims to balance the ambition of winning the prize and avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 and analyzing the previous rounds where bids often range close to perceived values, I aim to place a competitive bid without overbidding. Bids such as 65, 57, 56, and 55 from previous rounds suggest aggressive competitions when values are higher. Bidding 67 allows room for a decent profit and keeps me competitive, as it's close but slightly below my perceived value, enhancing my chances of winning without overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it makes sense to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data indicates that competitive bids often hover close to but below perceived values. Considering bids like 45, 44, 38, and 32 in previous rounds and my need to stay competitive, a bid of 33 provides a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and analyzing the past bidding patterns where an optimal bid generally lies slightly below the perceived value to maximize potential profit, I choose to bid 44. Previous rounds show that this approach balances competitiveness and profitability, as evidenced by my reasoning and data from earlier rounds. For example, bids slightly below perceived values often position bidders well without overpaying.

From past experience, a bid of around 32 balances the likelihood of winning against paying too much if I do win. The bids tend to cluster around mid-to-high ranges closer to their perceived value of the prize.'

A bid of 56 is high enough to likely outbid others without overbidding too close to my value of 65. With values and bids being independently redrawn each round, this strategic bid should balance the potential profit and winning likelihood.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 3, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 3, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the value for the prize is 3 this round, a very low bid like 1 is strategic. The previous rounds showed higher bids corresponding to higher values, but since my value is extremely low, the likelihood of winning is slim regardless. A bid of 1 minimizes potential losses while acknowledging the slim chance that others also have low values and may bid similarly low.'

This conservative strategy is suitable given the low value.'

A bid of 22 gives me a reasonable chance to win without overbidding and reduces potential losses, maintaining a balance between the likelihood of winning and ensuring a net positive profit if successful.'

The highest bids typically range just above the perceived values. Bidding 55 allows for a strong chance of winning without risking large negative profit by exceeding a reasonable threshold close to but below my perceived value.'

From previous rounds, it seems bids close to perceived values are common, with the highest bids slightly lower than the values. Therefore, a bid of 61 balances the likelihood of winning with the goal of maintaining a positive profit margin.'

To maximize my total profit while maintaining a high chance of winning, I will bid 50. This approach balances the probability of winning against the potential profit margin by not exceeding my perceived value too closely.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 54, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 57, 56, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 64, I want to bid strategically to increase my chances of winning while still retaining a good margin for profit. In the previous round, the highest bids were 45 and 44. To maximize my profit, I will bid 57, anticipating that the second-highest bid might still be close to the mid-40s or higher, ensuring my profit margin remains significant.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 3, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 15, I want to ensure my bid is low enough to avoid a loss, as winning while paying more than 15 would result in negative profit. The previous rounds had some high bids, often above 40. Given this trend, a lower bid like 9 might save resources for future rounds with potentially higher values while still providing an outside chance of winning if others lower their bids significantly.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 22, 2, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 16 and learning from previous rounds, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid a potential loss if I win the auction. Analyzing previous bids, I observed bids varying widely, and often the winning bid exceeded the value. With a value perceived at 16, a bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while also minimizing the risk of negative profit if the second-highest bid is comparatively higher.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 33 and based on the trend observed in previous rounds, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid negative profit while staying competitive. The previous bids had a range where the winning bids were often significantly higher. A bid of 20 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, maximizing my chances for a positive return if I win.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 55, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 62 and the history of previous bids, typically the second-highest bid has been significant enough to warrant a strategic but competitive bid. A bid of 47 positions me well to win without going too close to my perceived value, allowing for a potentially good margin for profit if the second-highest bid is lower but still competitive.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 71, I want to bid strategically considering past rounds. The winning bids and the second-highest bids fluctuated, but often the highest bids are realistic given the perceived value. Even though the second-highest bid tends to be significant, bidding moderately high, 58, balances the competitiveness with a chance of securing a good profit margin if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 55 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it appears that bids generally exceed values when perceived values are high, often leading to negative profits. A bid of 41 allows me to stay competitive, ensures a buffer below my perceived value to avoid negative profit, and accounts for the likelihood that the second-highest bid will be far lower than my bid.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 67, I analyze that previous rounds have shown high bids but often leading to narrow profit margins or even losses. To maximize my chance of winning while still ensuring a good profit, I will bid slightly above the middle value observed in prior rounds. A bid of 52 positions me to be competitive while allowing a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 31 and previous rounds have shown that higher bids tend to lead to narrower profit margins or even losses, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid a negative profit while staying competitive. A bid of 25 offers a strategic balance, allowing room to potentially win if the second-highest bid is around my expected range without risking a loss.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 37 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 55 this round, and based on the historical data from previous rounds, I observe that higher bids were often close to the perceived values but remained strategically below to avoid overpaying. To maximize my total profit while maintaining a high chance of winning, I will bid 50. This approach balances the probability of winning against the potential profit margin by not exceeding my perceived value too closely.'

From previous rounds, I observed that winning bids are often slightly below the perceived value, and overbidding can lead to negative profit. Hence, a bid of 45 balances the likelihood of winning with the goal of achieving a positive profit margin.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 4 and considering the bidding history from previous rounds where bids were significantly higher than the low value I currently have, it is highly unlikely that I will win with a low-value bid. Bidding 3 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, and it minimizes potential losses.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for this round, and based on the bidding patterns in previous rounds where bids have often been close to or above perceived values of the prizes, I choose to bid slightly lower than my perceived value. This strategy helps ensure I don't overpay and allows room for a durable profit if my bid is the highest or second-highest. Analyzing past bids, such as 9, 3, 10, 1 in round 2, shows competitiveness where lower values can still bring strategic advantage.'

For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. This approach aims to balance the ambition of winning the prize and avoiding overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 and analyzing the previous rounds where bids often range close to perceived values, I aim to place a competitive bid without overbidding. Bids such as 65, 57, 56, and 55 from previous rounds suggest aggressive competitions when values are higher. Bidding 67 allows room for a decent profit and keeps me competitive, as it's close but slightly below my perceived value, enhancing my chances of winning without overpaying.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it makes sense to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data indicates that competitive bids often hover close to but below perceived values. Considering bids like 45, 44, 38, and 32 in previous rounds and my need to stay competitive, a bid of 33 provides a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and analyzing the past bidding patterns where an optimal bid generally lies slightly below the perceived value to maximize potential profit, I choose to bid 44. Previous rounds show that this approach balances competitiveness and profitability, as evidenced by my reasoning and data from earlier rounds. For example, bids slightly below perceived values often position bidders well without overpaying. Thus, a bid of 44 aligns with this strategy and maintains a competitive edge.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or slightly above their perceived values. Historical bids have shown that being too aggressive yields little to no profit and sometimes losses. Therefore, I will bid 18 to stay competitive yet avoid overpaying. This bid allows room for potential profit while considering previous rounds where middle-range bids have been strategically advantageous.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 14 for the prize and the bidding behavior from previous rounds (with bids ranging from 32 to 65), I want to bid low enough to maximize any potential profit, considering the high bids from earlier rounds. Since my perceived value is relatively low, a bid of 10 allows me to participate without risking a significant loss, especially since the bid should be lower than my value to ensure positive profit if I win.'

In previous rounds, winning bids have ranged from 9 to 65 based on varying prize values.

Observing previous rounds, winning bids have ranged widely from 9 to 65. Setting my bid at 55 should be competitive, considering the need to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential profit margin.'

Observing previous rounds, the winning bids have typically ranged from the teens to the mid-50s, with a few higher outliers.

Earlier rounds have shown bids ranging widely, with recent winning bids around the mid-50s to low-60s. By setting my bid at 50, I position myself within a competitive range that balances the risk of overbidding while maximizing the potential for profit if I win. This strategy is prudent given the independent redrawing of values each round.'

The highest bids typically range just above the perceived values. Bidding 55 allows for a strong chance of winning without risking large negative profit by exceeding a reasonable threshold close to but below my perceived value.'

To maximize my total profit while maintaining a high chance of winning, I will bid 50. This approach balances the probability of winning against the potential profit margin by not exceeding my perceived value too closely.'

Taking into account that in the last round, bids were 45, 44, 38, and 32, bidding 45 this round keeps me competitive but avoids overpaying.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is only 4 and considering the bidding history from previous rounds where bids were significantly higher than the low value I currently have, it is highly unlikely that I will win with a low-value bid. Bidding 3 allows me to stay in the game without overcommitting, and it minimizes potential losses.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for this round, and based on the bidding patterns in previous rounds where bids have often been close to or above perceived values of the prizes, I choose to bid slightly lower than my perceived value. This strategy helps ensure I don't overpay and allows room for a durable profit if my bid is the highest or second-highest. Analyzing past bids, such as 9, 3, 10, 1 in round 2, shows competitiveness where lower values can still bring strategic advantage.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In evaluating my perceived value of 35 and considering previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or above their perceived values. For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. This approach aims to balance the ambition of winning the prize and avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 and analyzing the previous rounds where bids often range close to perceived values, I aim to place a competitive bid without overbidding. Bids such as 65, 57, 56, and 55 from previous rounds suggest aggressive competitions when values are higher. Bidding 67 allows room for a decent profit and keeps me competitive, as it's close but slightly below my perceived value, enhancing my chances of winning without overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it makes sense to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data indicates that competitive bids often hover close to but below perceived values. Considering bids like 45, 44, 38, and 32 in previous rounds and my need to stay competitive, a bid of 33 provides a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and analyzing the past bidding patterns where an optimal bid generally lies slightly below the perceived value to maximize potential profit, I choose to bid 44. Previous rounds show that this approach balances competitiveness and profitability, as evidenced by my reasoning and data from earlier rounds. For example, bids slightly below perceived values often position bidders well without overpaying. Thus, a bid of 44 aligns with this strategy and maintains a competitive edge.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or slightly above their perceived values. Historical bids have shown that being too aggressive yields little to no profit and sometimes losses. Therefore, I will bid 18 to stay competitive yet avoid overpaying. This bid allows room for potential profit while considering previous rounds where middle-range bids have been strategically advantageous.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 25, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value for this round is 37, and analyzing past rounds where bids slightly below perceived values have typically been effective, a bid of 30 allows me to stay competitive without overbidding. The previous rounds show that high bids can lead to minimal or negative profit, while strategic bids just below the perceived value provide a good balance between winning and potential profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 42, 30.

Historical data shows successful bids often lie within 10-15 units below the perceived value. Bidding 42 provides a competitive stance without the risk of overpaying, considering aggressive bidding patterns observed in past rounds where the highest bid tends to be close to or above the perceived value.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 74, I want to ensure a potential profit while considering the previous round's bidding pattern. Last round, bids varied between 32 and 45. Setting my bid at 65 should make me competitive, balancing the risk of overbidding while ensuring a reasonable margin if I win. Each round is independent, but observed patterns suggest a prudent bid below my value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 3, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 14 for the prize and the bidding behavior from previous rounds (with bids ranging from 32 to 65), I want to bid low enough to maximize any potential profit, considering the high bids from earlier rounds. Since my perceived value is relatively low, a bid of 10 allows me to participate without risking a significant loss, especially since the bid should be lower than my value to ensure positive profit if I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 22, 2, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 28 for the prize and considering the bidding behavior from previous rounds, I want to place a bid that is high enough to be competitive but still leaves room for profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have ranged from 9 to 65 based on varying prize values. Since my perceived value is relatively low this round, a bid of 22 positions me better within the competitive range without exceeding my perceived value, balancing the risk with potential profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 31, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and considering the bidding behavior from previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be competitive but often vary widely. Based on past bids (ranging from 1 to 65), setting my bid at 31 should position me well within this competitive range while ensuring a reasonable margin for profit if I win. This strategy aims to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential to maximize my total profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 55, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 62, I want to bid just under my perceived value to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a profit. Observing previous rounds, winning bids have ranged widely from 9 to 65. Setting my bid at 55 should be competitive, considering the need to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential profit margin.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 56, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 71, I want to choose a bid that is competitive but still allows room for profit. Observing previous rounds, the winning bids have typically ranged from the teens to the mid-50s, with a few higher outliers. Setting my bid at 56 should make me competitive and provide a reasonable margin for profit while balancing the risk of overbidding.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, setting my bid at 33 should be competitive while leaving room for profit. Observing the range of previous bids, especially the most recent rounds where winning bids have varied, this bid positions me within a reasonable range to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential for maximizing my profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 63 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I aim to bid conservatively but still competitively. Earlier rounds have shown bids ranging widely, with recent winning bids around the mid-50s to low-60s. By setting my bid at 50, I position myself within a competitive range that balances the risk of overbidding while maximizing the potential for profit if I win. This strategy is prudent given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, setting a bid at 25 should position me competitively while providing a reasonable margin for profit should I win. Observing past rounds, where bids have varied widely but often sit in the mid-range, a bid of 25 should balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for maximizing profit given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 25, 23.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, I aim to bid competitively yet conservatively to ensure a potential profit if I win. Observing recent rounds, winning bids have generally ranged between the mid-40s and low-60s. Bidding 48 positions me competitively while allowing a decent margin for profit if I secure the win.

From past experience, a bid of around 32 balances the likelihood of winning against paying too much if I do win.

In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 35, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In evaluating my perceived value of 35 and considering previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or above their perceived values. For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 55, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. This approach aims to balance the ambition of winning the prize and avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 and analyzing the previous rounds where bids often range close to perceived values, I aim to place a competitive bid without overbidding. Bids such as 65, 57, 56, and 55 from previous rounds suggest aggressive competitions when values are higher. Bidding 67 allows room for a decent profit and keeps me competitive, as it's close but slightly below my perceived value, enhancing my chances of winning without overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it makes sense to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data indicates that competitive bids often hover close to but below perceived values. Considering bids like 45, 44, 38, and 32 in previous rounds and my need to stay competitive, a bid of 33 provides a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and analyzing the past bidding patterns where an optimal bid generally lies slightly below the perceived value to maximize potential profit, I choose to bid 44. Previous rounds show that this approach balances competitiveness and profitability, as evidenced by my reasoning and data from earlier rounds. For example, bids slightly below perceived values often position bidders well without overpaying. Thus, a bid of 44 aligns with this strategy and maintains a competitive edge.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or slightly above their perceived values. Historical bids have shown that being too aggressive yields little to no profit and sometimes losses. Therefore, I will bid 18 to stay competitive yet avoid overpaying. This bid allows room for potential profit while considering previous rounds where middle-range bids have been strategically advantageous.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 25, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value for this round is 37, and analyzing past rounds where bids slightly below perceived values have typically been effective, a bid of 30 allows me to stay competitive without overbidding. The previous rounds show that high bids can lead to minimal or negative profit, while strategic bids just below the perceived value provide a good balance between winning and potential profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 42, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 51 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds, it is optimal to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data shows successful bids often lie within 10-15 units below the perceived value. Bidding 42 provides a competitive stance without the risk of overpaying, considering aggressive bidding patterns observed in past rounds where the highest bid tends to be close to or above the perceived value. This approach maintains a balance between winning and avoiding excessive payments.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 24, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 37 and analyzing previous round outcomes and bidding strategies, a bid of 30 should keep me competitive without the risk of overpaying. Historical data suggests that bids just below perceived values (e.g., a bid 7-10 units below) tend to be effective in securing the prize while allowing room for profit. This approach will help balance my chances of winning and maximize potential profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 29 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Analyzing previous bids, I observed bids varying widely, and often the winning bid exceeded the value. With a value perceived at 16, a bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while also minimizing the risk of negative profit if the second-highest bid is comparatively higher.'

Since the values and bids are redrawn independently each round, aiming too high can incur unnecessary risk.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and considering the bidding behavior from previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be competitive but often vary widely. Based on past bids (ranging from 1 to 65), setting my bid at 31 should position me well within this competitive range while ensuring a reasonable margin for profit if I win. This strategy aims to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential to maximize my total profit.'

Observing previous rounds, winning bids have ranged widely from 9 to 65. Setting my bid at 55 should be competitive, considering the need to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential profit margin.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 71, I want to choose a bid that is competitive but still allows room for profit. Observing previous rounds, the winning bids have typically ranged from the teens to the mid-50s, with a few higher outliers. Setting my bid at 56 should make me competitive and provide a reasonable margin for profit while balancing the risk of overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, setting my bid at 33 should be competitive while leaving room for profit. Observing the range of previous bids, especially the most recent rounds where winning bids have varied, this bid positions me within a reasonable range to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential for maximizing my profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 63 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I aim to bid conservatively but still competitively. Earlier rounds have shown bids ranging widely, with recent winning bids around the mid-50s to low-60s. By setting my bid at 50, I position myself within a competitive range that balances the risk of overbidding while maximizing the potential for profit if I win. This strategy is prudent given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, setting a bid at 25 should position me competitively while providing a reasonable margin for profit should I win. Observing past rounds, where bids have varied widely but often sit in the mid-range, a bid of 25 should balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for maximizing profit given the independent redrawing of values each round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, I aim to bid competitively yet conservatively to ensure a potential profit if I win. Observing recent rounds, winning bids have generally ranged between the mid-40s and low-60s. Bidding 48 positions me competitively while allowing a decent margin for profit if I secure the win. This strategy maintains a balance between the risk of overbidding and maximizing potential profit, given the independent redrawing of values each round.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In evaluating my perceived value of 35 and considering previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or above their perceived values. For instance, in round 1, others bid 65, 57, and 56 when my bid was 45. Thus, an optimal strategy involves bidding slightly lower than my perceived value, while being competitive enough to win. Given all this, bidding 30 allows room for the potential profit without excessive risk.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 55, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 65 and the past bidding patterns, particularly the high bids in rounds where values have been higher (e.g., 65, 57, 56 in round 1), a bid of 55 is strategically placed to be competitive while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. This approach aims to balance the ambition of winning the prize and avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 and analyzing the previous rounds where bids often range close to perceived values, I aim to place a competitive bid without overbidding. Bids such as 65, 57, 56, and 55 from previous rounds suggest aggressive competitions when values are higher. Bidding 67 allows room for a decent profit and keeps me competitive, as it's close but slightly below my perceived value, enhancing my chances of winning without overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it makes sense to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data indicates that competitive bids often hover close to but below perceived values. Considering bids like 45, 44, 38, and 32 in previous rounds and my need to stay competitive, a bid of 33 provides a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and analyzing the past bidding patterns where an optimal bid generally lies slightly below the perceived value to maximize potential profit, I choose to bid 44. Previous rounds show that this approach balances competitiveness and profitability, as evidenced by my reasoning and data from earlier rounds. For example, bids slightly below perceived values often position bidders well without overpaying. Thus, a bid of 44 aligns with this strategy and maintains a competitive edge.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for this round and analyzing previous rounds, bidders tend to bid numbers close to or slightly above their perceived values. Historical bids have shown that being too aggressive yields little to no profit and sometimes losses. Therefore, I will bid 18 to stay competitive yet avoid overpaying. This bid allows room for potential profit while considering previous rounds where middle-range bids have been strategically advantageous.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 25, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value for this round is 37, and analyzing past rounds where bids slightly below perceived values have typically been effective, a bid of 30 allows me to stay competitive without overbidding. The previous rounds show that high bids can lead to minimal or negative profit, while strategic bids just below the perceived value provide a good balance between winning and potential profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 42, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 51 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds, it is optimal to bid slightly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit. Historical data shows successful bids often lie within 10-15 units below the perceived value. Bidding 42 provides a competitive stance without the risk of overpaying, considering aggressive bidding patterns observed in past rounds where the highest bid tends to be close to or above the perceived value. This approach maintains a balance between winning and avoiding excessive payments.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 24, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 37 and analyzing previous round outcomes and bidding strategies, a bid of 30 should keep me competitive without the risk of overpaying. Historical data suggests that bids just below perceived values (e.g., a bid 7-10 units below) tend to be effective in securing the prize while allowing room for profit. This approach will help balance my chances of winning and maximize potential profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 29 for this round and analyzing historical data, it appears that competitive bids often lie slightly below perceived values, with successful ranges being 7-15 units lower. With bids like 28, 30, 45, and 33 in previous rounds, bidding 20 positions me strongly without the risk of overpaying, thus maximizing potential profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 27 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 14 for the prize and the bidding behavior from previous rounds (with bids ranging from 32 to 65), I want to bid low enough to maximize any potential profit, considering the high bids from earlier rounds. Since my perceived value is relatively low, a bid of 10 allows me to participate without risking a significant loss, especially since the bid should be lower than my value to ensure positive profit if I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 22, 2, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 28 for the prize and considering the bidding behavior from previous rounds, I want to place a bid that is high enough to be competitive but still leaves room for profit. In previous rounds, winning bids have ranged from 9 to 65 based on varying prize values. Since my perceived value is relatively low this round, a bid of 22 positions me better within the competitive range without exceeding my perceived value, balancing the risk with potential profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 31, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and considering the bidding behavior from previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be competitive but often vary widely. Based on past bids (ranging from 1 to 65), setting my bid at 31 should position me well within this competitive range while ensuring a reasonable margin for profit if I win. This strategy aims to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential to maximize my total profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 55, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 62, I want to bid just under my perceived value to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a profit. Observing previous rounds, winning bids have ranged widely from 9 to 65. Setting my bid at 55 should be competitive, considering the need to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential profit margin.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 56, the (true) common value of the prize was 66, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 67, 61, 58, 56. The highest bidder won with a bid of 67 and paid 61. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 71, I want to choose a bid that is competitive but still allows room for profit. Observing previous rounds, the winning bids have typically ranged from the teens to the mid-50s, with a few higher outliers. Setting my bid at 56 should make me competitive and provide a reasonable margin for profit while balancing the risk of overbidding.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 41, 33, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 41. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, setting my bid at 33 should be competitive while leaving room for profit. Observing the range of previous bids, especially the most recent rounds where winning bids have varied, this bid positions me within a reasonable range to balance the risk of overbidding and the potential for maximizing my profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 50, 45, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 63 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I aim to bid conservatively but still competitively. Earlier rounds have shown bids ranging widely, with recent winning bids around the mid-50s to low-60s. By setting my bid at 50, I position myself within a competitive range that balances the risk of overbidding while maximizing the potential for profit if I win. This strategy is prudent given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, setting a bid at 25 should position me competitively while providing a reasonable margin for profit should I win. Observing past rounds, where bids have varied widely but often sit in the mid-range, a bid of 25 should balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for maximizing profit given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 30, 25, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, setting a bid at 25 should position me competitively while providing a reasonable margin for profit should I win. Observing past rounds where bids have varied widely but often sit in the mid-range, a bid of 25 should balance the risk of overbidding with the potential for maximizing profit given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 45, 42, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for the prize this round and considering the previous rounds' bidding behaviors, I aim to bid competitively yet conservatively to ensure a potential profit if I win. Observing recent rounds, winning bids have generally ranged between the mid-40s and low-60s. Bidding 48 positions me competitively while allowing a decent margin for profit if I secure the win. This strategy maintains a balance between the risk of overbidding and maximizing potential profit, given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 17, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 24, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 for this round, I need to bid conservatively to maximize my profit while being competitive. Observing previous rounds, I noticed that bids varied widely, often in the mid-20s to mid-30s, with some rounds having higher winning bids up to the 50s. To balance the risk of overbidding and ensure a margin of profit, a bid of 24 places me in a competitive range without exceeding my perceived value, given the independent redrawing of values each round.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 15, 12.

Observing the previous winning bids, especially in lower value rounds (typically in the mid-20s to 30s), I see that a bid within the lower to mid-20s range has been competitive.

From past experience, a bid of around 32 balances the likelihood of winning against paying too much if I do win.

A bid of 56 is high enough to likely outbid others without overbidding too close to my value of 65. With values and bids being independently redrawn each round, this strategic bid should balance the potential profit and winning likelihood.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 64, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 68, 64, 64. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 78, I want to bid an amount that balances the risk of overbidding and the potential for profit. In the previous round, the bids were 69, 67, 66, and 61, with the highest bid being 69 and the winner paid 67. To maximize my profit while still standing a good chance of winning, I'll bid slightly lower than my perceived value but high enough to potentially win. A bid of 64 achieves this balance by staying competitive without bidding too close to my total value, taking into account other bidders might have fluctuating values.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 26, and considering the previous rounds where bids varied but the highest bidders paid amounts close to their perceived values, I aim to bid lower than my value to ensure I don't overpay. A bid of 17 strikes a balance, offering a chance to win if others undervalue while avoiding significant losses if outbid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 38, 32, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 53 and analyzing from the previous rounds' bid patterns, it is apparent that high bids often come with high perceived values. Bidding around 45 allows me to stay competitive without risking overpaying compared to the second-highest bid, should I win. This balances the strategy of maximizing potential profit while minimizing loss if outbid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 45, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and the historical bids from the previous rounds, it is apparent that significant reduction from the perceived value is a common strategy. A bid of 52 allows me to stay competitive without bidding too close to my value. The highest bids in previous rounds were usually lower than the perceived value but still aimed at ensuring winning while mitigating losses. This bid strikes a balance between remaining competitive and maximizing potential profit by keeping sufficient margin below my perceived value.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 18, 10, 1.

Previous rounds have shown that bids tend to be close to or slightly below perceived values. By bidding 9, I strike a balance between being competitive and not risking a loss, as any winning bid would need to pay the second-highest bid, which might often be significantly lower than the highest bid.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 63 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, my bids have not resulted in a profit, as the winning bids were quite close to the second-highest bids. Given my value of 23 for this round, I will bid conservatively at 18. This strategy could allow me to win if the other bids are low, while minimizing potential losses if I win and have to pay a high second-highest bid. Historically, bidders tend to bid slightly below their perceived values, so a bid of 18 positions me to potentially profit without excessive risk.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 38, 32, 27.

With my perceived value being 43, I will bid 38 to maximize potential profit if I win the auction and to remain competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying due to a high second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 45, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, I observed that winning bids tend to cluster slightly below the bidders' perceived values, and that the second-highest bid can vary but typically is a few units below the winning bid. Given my perceived value of 46 for this round, I will bid 41 to place myself in a position to win the prize without excessively overpaying. This strategy should maximize potential profit by covering a range close to the second-highest bids while providing a reasonable margin below my perceived value.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 4, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 18, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bidders tend to bid slightly below their perceived values. My current perceived value for this round is 4, which is quite low. To maximize my total profit, I will place a very conservative bid of 1. This strategy enables me to avoid significant losses while still participating in the auction. Since the values are redrawn independently each round, it is unlikely that the other bids will be as low, minimizing my risk.'

By bidding 70, I aim to outbid the previous high bids slightly, increasing my chances of winning while balancing profitability.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 26 for this round, I want to bid cautiously to maximize profitability while staying competitive. In previous rounds, the winning bids were around 70, which was much higher than my current value of 26. By bidding 22, I maintain a chance to win if the common value is low, while minimizing potential losses if my bid doesn't win.'

In previous rounds, the winning bids have ranged from the low 20s to the 70s. Given that the common value can be higher or lower than my perceived value, I\u2019ll aim to strike a balance between winning the auction and maintaining profitability. By bidding 27, I ensure that I have a competitive bid in the lower range that still allows for a good margin based on potential common value with limited risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 48 for this round and analyzing the previous bidding patterns, the highest winning bids have been as low as 35 and as high as 70. To maximize profit, I need to place a moderately competitive bid. Since the second-highest bid is what determines the cost, bidding 36 offers a balance between being competitive and leaving room for profitability, as it's near the middle of the previous winning bid ranges.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 20 for this round, I want to bid more cautiously to ensure I maintain a chance to win without risking a loss. Previous rounds showed some bids as low as the teens and twenties, especially in rounds where the perceived values were lower. By bidding 18, I remain competitive if the common value is low, while also minimizing potential losses and aiming for profitability.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 and looking at the history of previous bids, it seems that moderately higher bids tend to win, but profitability is impacted by the second-highest bid. Bidding too conservatively can result in not winning the prize, while overbidding reduces profit. Placing a bid of 45 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit, as it aligns with the observed range of winning bids without excessively increasing potential loss.'

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 38, 32, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, I notice that the winning bidder usually places a bid slightly below their perceived value, and the second-highest bid tends to be fairly significant but not too close to the winning bid. With my perceived value being 43, I will bid 38 to maximize potential profit if I win the auction and to remain competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying due to a high second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 45, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, I observed that winning bids tend to cluster slightly below the bidders' perceived values, and that the second-highest bid can vary but typically is a few units below the winning bid. Given my perceived value of 46 for this round, I will bid 41 to place myself in a position to win the prize without excessively overpaying. This strategy should maximize potential profit by covering a range close to the second-highest bids while providing a reasonable margin below my perceived value.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 4, you bid 1, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 18, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bidders tend to bid slightly below their perceived values. My current perceived value for this round is 4, which is quite low. To maximize my total profit, I will place a very conservative bid of 1. This strategy enables me to avoid significant losses while still participating in the auction. Since the values are redrawn independently each round, it is unlikely that the other bids will be as low, minimizing my risk.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 63, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 47, 45, 40.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of previous rounds, it appears that winning bids tend to be slightly lower than the perceived values, and the second-highest bids tend to cluster a few units below the winning bids. With my perceived value being 68, I will bid 63 to place myself in a competitive position to win without excessively overpaying. This bid allows me to cover a reasonable range below my perceived value while positioning myself well against typical second-highest bids. Additionally, it provides a margin for potential profit if I win the auction.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 3. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 45, 39.

With my perceived value being 50, I will bid 45. This strategic bid should place me in a competitive position to potentially win the auction without excessively overpaying. It reflects a balance between staying competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, thereby maximizing potential profit.'

In the previous round, the bids were 69, 67, 66, and 61, with the highest bid being 69 and the winner paid 67. To maximize my profit while still standing a good chance of winning, I'll bid slightly lower than my perceived value but high enough to potentially win. A bid of 64 achieves this balance by staying competitive without bidding too close to my total value, taking into account other bidders might have fluctuating values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 67. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high perceived value of 79 for this round, I want to place a competitive bid. Since I need to balance outwinning while aiming for a profit, bidding slightly lower, around 69, maximizes my chances of winning without significantly impacting profitability.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 68, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 68, 64, 64. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that in the previous round, a bid of 69 won with the other top bids being close (67 and 66), and my perceived value for this round is 83, I want to place a competitive yet profitable bid. By bidding 70, I aim to outbid the previous high bids slightly, increasing my chances of winning while balancing profitability.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 26 for this round, I want to bid cautiously to maximize profitability while staying competitive. In previous rounds, the winning bids were around 70, which was much higher than my current value of 26. By bidding 22, I maintain a chance to win if the common value is low, while minimizing potential losses if my bid doesn't win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 39 for this round, I want to bid competitively but cautiously to maximize my profit. In previous rounds, the winning bids have ranged from the low 20s to the 70s. Given that the common value can be higher or lower than my perceived value, I\u2019ll aim to strike a balance between winning the auction and maintaining profitability. By bidding 27, I ensure that I have a competitive bid in the lower range that still allows for a good margin based on potential common value with limited risk.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 45, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 48 for this round and analyzing the previous bidding patterns, the highest winning bids have been as low as 35 and as high as 70. To maximize profit, I need to place a moderately competitive bid. Since the second-highest bid is what determines the cost, bidding 36 offers a balance between being competitive and leaving room for profitability, as it's near the middle of the previous winning bid ranges.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 18, 10, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 20 for this round, I want to bid more cautiously to ensure I maintain a chance to win without risking a loss. Previous rounds showed some bids as low as the teens and twenties, especially in rounds where the perceived values were lower. By bidding 18, I remain competitive if the common value is low, while also minimizing potential losses and aiming for profitability.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 47, 45, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 and looking at the history of previous bids, it seems that moderately higher bids tend to win, but profitability is impacted by the second-highest bid. Bidding too conservatively can result in not winning the prize, while overbidding reduces profit. Placing a bid of 45 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit, as it aligns with the observed range of winning bids without excessively increasing potential loss.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 45, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 51 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds, a competitive yet cautious approach is essential to maximize profitability. Historical trends suggest that winning bids tend to be moderately higher but not excessively so. By bidding 39, I ensure a good chance of winning while maintaining a buffer for potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to my bid.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 41, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 52 and analyzing the trends from previous rounds, the winning bids typically fall between a moderate to high range, but higher bids potentially reduce profitability. By bidding 41, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive for this prize value and maintaining a potential for profit based on the second-highest bid. Additionally, this bid is reflective of the cautious yet competitive approach taken in earlier rounds where the perceived values were similar.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 59, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 59, 57, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for this round and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I notice that moderately competitive bids often win. My perceived values have varied, and bidding too conservatively has often led to losing the auction, while overbidding reduces profitability. By bidding 59, I am aiming to balance competitiveness with a chance for a decent profit. Previous rounds show that the winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to the 70s, and a bid of 59 should be fairly competitive given these dynamics while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is close.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 14 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 69 and paid 67. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 72, I will bid slightly below my total value to ensure a potential profit while risking being outbid by others if their values are higher. From previous rounds, I have learned that bidding too close to my value might minimize my profit due to the second-highest bid payment rule.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 78, I want to bid an amount that balances the risk of overbidding and the potential for profit. In the previous round, the bids were 69, 67, 66, and 61, with the highest bid being 69 and the winner paid 67. To maximize my profit while still standing a good chance of winning, I'll bid slightly lower than my perceived value but high enough to potentially win. A bid of 64 achieves this balance by staying competitive without bidding too close to my total value, taking into account other bidders might have fluctuating values.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 22, 18, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 26, and considering the previous rounds where bids varied but the highest bidders paid amounts close to their perceived values, I aim to bid lower than my value to ensure I don't overpay. A bid of 17 strikes a balance, offering a chance to win if others undervalue while avoiding significant losses if outbid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 38, 32, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 53 and analyzing from the previous rounds' bid patterns, it is apparent that high bids often come with high perceived values. Bidding around 45 allows me to stay competitive without risking overpaying compared to the second-highest bid, should I win. This balances the strategy of maximizing potential profit while minimizing loss if outbid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 42, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 45, 41, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and the historical bids from the previous rounds, it is apparent that significant reduction from the perceived value is a common strategy. A bid of 52 allows me to stay competitive without bidding too close to my value. The highest bids in previous rounds were usually lower than the perceived value but still aimed at ensuring winning while mitigating losses. This bid strikes a balance between remaining competitive and maximizing potential profit by keeping sufficient margin below my perceived value.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 4, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 18, 10, 1.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 10, and considering the historical bids from the previous rounds, the aim here is to place a bid that ensures I'm competitive without overbidding. Previous rounds have shown that bids tend to be close to or slightly below perceived values. By bidding 9, I strike a balance between being competitive and not risking a loss, as any winning bid would need to pay the second-highest bid, which might often be significantly lower than the highest bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 47, 45, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 63, and based on the historical data from previous rounds where successful bids have generally been significantly below the perceived values, I believe a bid of 47 balances the potential profit and the likelihood of winning the prize. This bid is strategically lower than my perceived value to avoid overpaying while staying competitive given the second-highest bid payment rule.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 64, we need to consider the previous rounds where there have been various bidding ranges. Typically, winning bids have been significantly below their perceived values but high enough to outbid others. From my historical bids and others' patterns, aiming slightly below mid-range of my value but still competitive seems reasonable. By bidding 49, I strike a balance between staying competitive and reducing the risk of overpaying based on the second-highest bid payment rule.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 41, 33.

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, and learning from the previous rounds where the successful strategies often involved bidding significantly below the perceived value to balance potential profit and likelihood of winning, I would aim to stay competitive while avoiding overpaying. The previous highest bids that won ranged typically from lower than the perceived value but still managed to outbid others. A bid of 47 should balance this approach, providing a chance to win without risking a major loss.'

Previous rounds showed some bids as low as the teens and twenties, especially in rounds where the perceived values were lower. By bidding 18, I remain competitive if the common value is low, while also minimizing potential losses and aiming for profitability.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 47, 45, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 and looking at the history of previous bids, it seems that moderately higher bids tend to win, but profitability is impacted by the second-highest bid. Bidding too conservatively can result in not winning the prize, while overbidding reduces profit. Placing a bid of 45 strikes a balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit, as it aligns with the observed range of winning bids without excessively increasing potential loss.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 49, 45, 45, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 49 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 51 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds, a competitive yet cautious approach is essential to maximize profitability. Historical trends suggest that winning bids tend to be moderately higher but not excessively so. By bidding 39, I ensure a good chance of winning while maintaining a buffer for potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to my bid.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 41, 33. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 52 and analyzing the trends from previous rounds, the winning bids typically fall between a moderate to high range, but higher bids potentially reduce profitability. By bidding 41, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive for this prize value and maintaining a potential for profit based on the second-highest bid. Additionally, this bid is reflective of the cautious yet competitive approach taken in earlier rounds where the perceived values were similar.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 59, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 59, 57, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for this round and analyzing the history of previous rounds, I notice that moderately competitive bids often win. My perceived values have varied, and bidding too conservatively has often led to losing the auction, while overbidding reduces profitability. By bidding 59, I am aiming to balance competitiveness with a chance for a decent profit. Previous rounds show that the winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to the 70s, and a bid of 59 should be fairly competitive given these dynamics while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is close.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 14 for this round, I will bid conservatively to maximize my total profit. Historical data indicates a trend where higher bids lead to minimal or negative profit when the perceived value is low.

Previous rounds showed some bids as low as the teens and twenties, especially in rounds where the perceived values were lower.

By bidding 41, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive for this prize value and maintaining a potential for profit based on the second-highest bid. Additionally, this bid is reflective of the cautious yet competitive approach taken in earlier rounds where the perceived values were similar.'

My perceived values have varied, and bidding too conservatively has often led to losing the auction, while overbidding reduces profitability. By bidding 59, I am aiming to balance competitiveness with a chance for a decent profit. Previous rounds show that the winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to the 70s, and a bid of 59 should be fairly competitive given these dynamics while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is close.'

Historical data indicates a trend where higher bids lead to minimal or negative profit when the perceived value is low. By bidding 10, I maintain a competitive stance without risking significant losses if my bid doesn't win.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since the values are independent each round and I have no historical information at the moment, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value of 85. This strategic bid reduces the risk of overpaying if I win by ensuring I am often the highest bidder but only when the second-highest bid is far enough below my value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history of the previous round, where bids were clustered fairly closely to each bidder's perceived values but slightly below, a strategic bid that is a few units below my perceived value of 69 should position me well to either win at a reasonable price or avoid overpaying. By bidding 64, I aim to cover the majority of possible second-highest bids while leaving a margin for profit if I win the auction.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, my bids have not resulted in a profit, as the winning bids were quite close to the second-highest bids. Given my value of 23 for this round, I will bid conservatively at 18. This strategy could allow me to win if the other bids are low, while minimizing potential losses if I win and have to pay a high second-highest bid. Historically, bidders tend to bid slightly below their perceived values, so a bid of 18 positions me to potentially profit without excessive risk.'

My current perceived value for this round is 4, which is quite low. To maximize my total profit, I will place a very conservative bid of 1. This strategy enables me to avoid significant losses while still participating in the auction.

My perceived value for this round is 55. By bidding 50, I position myself competitively to win the auction while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This bid provides a balance between being sufficiently high to potentially win and preserving a margin for profit by staying below my perceived value. Additionally, it falls into the usual range of second-highest bids, increasing my chances of winning at the best possible price.'

Prior winning bids often range around the mid-40s or higher, especially when perceived value is moderate to high.

In round 5, with a similar value of 18, bidding 10 led to others bidding conservatively as well. A bid of 9 accounts for a slight adjustment to stay competitive while maintaining a good margin for potential profit.'

By bidding 41, I aim to strike a balance between being competitive for this prize value and maintaining a potential for profit based on the second-highest bid. Additionally, this bid is reflective of the cautious yet competitive approach taken in earlier rounds where the perceived values were similar.'

My perceived values have varied, and bidding too conservatively has often led to losing the auction, while overbidding reduces profitability. By bidding 59, I am aiming to balance competitiveness with a chance for a decent profit. Previous rounds show that the winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to the 70s, and a bid of 59 should be fairly competitive given these dynamics while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is close.'

My aim here is to strike a balance between remaining competitive and maximizing profitability. Historical data shows that excessively high bids reduce profits substantially while moderately competitive bids in the 50s to 60s range have a better chance of winning. By bidding 55, I aim to combine competitiveness with a higher margin for potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to mine.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 77, 66, 55, 55.

Given my value of 23 for this round, I will bid conservatively at 18. This strategy could allow me to win if the other bids are low, while minimizing potential losses if I win and have to pay a high second-highest bid.

Analyzing previous rounds, higher perceived values generate higher bids, often in the 60s or 70s. In rounds with moderate perceived values, bids trend lower.

Prior winning bids often range around the mid-40s or higher, especially when perceived value is moderate to high.

In past rounds, winning bids for perceived values in this range are often in the high 40s to low 50s. Therefore, bidding 50 allows me to be close to the top without overbidding, offering a good chance to win while minimizing financial risk.'

My perceived values have varied, and bidding too conservatively has often led to losing the auction, while overbidding reduces profitability. By bidding 59, I am aiming to balance competitiveness with a chance for a decent profit. Previous rounds show that the winning bids have ranged from the mid-30s to the 70s, and a bid of 59 should be fairly competitive given these dynamics while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is close.'

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 54, and learning from the previous rounds where the successful strategies often involved bidding significantly below the perceived value to balance potential profit and likelihood of winning, I would aim to stay competitive while avoiding overpaying. The previous highest bids that won ranged typically from lower than the perceived value but still managed to outbid others. A bid of 47 should balance this approach, providing a chance to win without risking a major loss.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 59, 57, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 77, and considering the historical bids where the highest successful bids have generally been significantly below perceived values, a bid of 57 strikes a balance. It allows me to stay competitive enough to win, without overpaying. This bid is strategically lower than my perceived value to maximize potential profit while accounting for the second-highest bid payment rule.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 21, and learning from the previous rounds where bidding slightly lower than perceived value is a common strategy to avoid overpaying, I'll bid 14. This allows me to stay competitive without risking a significant loss. Previous successful bids have often been just slightly below the perceivable value but high enough to outbid others.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 71, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 71, 55, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 71 and paid 71. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 92 for the prize and historical bids where higher-value items typically attract higher bids, I aim to bid conservatively yet competitively. Previous rounds show that successful bids are often significantly below perceived values but still aim to outbid competitors. By bidding 71, I balance the likelihood of winning and minimizing overpayment, maximizing potential profit considering the second-highest bid payment rule.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 66, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 77, 66, 55, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 77 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 78, and analyzing the bid patterns from prior rounds, bids are often significantly below the perceived values but strategically placed to stay competitive. In this context, bidding 66 seems optimal as it provides a balance of being competitive while mitigating the risk of overpaying. This strategy leverages the expectation that other bidders will also bid lower values, allowing a potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within an expected range.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 50, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 50. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 59, and considering the historical data where bids significantly below the perceived values were prevalent, I would aim to stay competitive without overbidding. From previous rounds, bids around the 40-50 range often won based on the second-highest bid rule.

I need to bid strategically, ensuring I don't overbid, while still giving myself a good chance of winning. A bid of 68 should balance competitiveness and potential profit, considering the second-highest bid determines my payment if I win.'

In previous rounds, bids have varied based on perceived value but tend to be lower when perceived values are lower. By bidding 32, I balance staying competitive while not overbidding and leaving room for profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, higher perceived values generate higher bids, often in the 60s or 70s. In rounds with moderate perceived values, bids trend lower. Bidding 45 should position me competitively, likely below the highest bid yet within range to potentially win if others underbid or value the prize similarly, ensuring a good margin for profit if I win by paying the second-highest bid.'

Prior winning bids often range around the mid-40s or higher, especially when perceived value is moderate to high.

In round 5, with a similar value of 18, bidding 10 led to others bidding conservatively as well. A bid of 9 accounts for a slight adjustment to stay competitive while maintaining a good margin for potential profit.'
