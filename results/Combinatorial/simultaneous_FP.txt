In this game, you will participate in an auction for two goods A and B against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their values for each unit, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely. However, a bidderâ€™s valuation towards both goods A and B combined will be double the sum, 2*(v(A)+ v(B)). 
Bidders will submit bids for each unit demanded simultaneously. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments. For each item, the bidder with the highest bid will win the item and pay their bid.
After each auction, we will display all bids and profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
