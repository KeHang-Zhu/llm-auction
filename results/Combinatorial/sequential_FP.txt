In this game, you will participate in an auction for two goods A and B against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their values for each unit, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely. However,if you win both goods A and B, your value will be doubled, 2*(v(A)+ v(B)). 
Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments. For each item, the bidder with the highest bid will get the item at the bid price.
The auction has two stages. The first stage auctions the first item, where the highest bidder gets the item and pays the corresponding bid price. After the first stage bids are in, winners are informed whether they won the good and the price they paid. 
The second stage auctions the second item, and you will need to decide what bid you place given your outcome in the first stage. Again, the highest bidder gets the item and pays their bid.
After each auction, we will display all bids and profits. Ties for the highest bid in each stage will be resolved randomly.
For example, if your value for item A is $69 and B is $45. Your value for the bundle AB is 2*(69+45)=$228. If you won A with a bid of $x but didn't win B, your profit is 69-x. But if you won A at $x and B at $y, your profit is 228-x-y.
