In this game, you will participate in an auction for two goods A and B against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. 
At the start of each round, bidders will see their values for each unit, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely. However, a bidderâ€™s valuation towards good A and B combined will be double the sum, 2*(v(A)+ v(B)). 
You can bid on any of the following options: receiving good A, good B, or both good A and good B(AB). 
The allocation and pricing will be determined as follows: If the highest bid for both A and B (AB) exceeds the sum of the highest bids for A and B individually, the bidder with the highest bid on AB receives both goods at their bid price. Otherwise, the highest bidders for A and B individually will each receive the respective good at their bid price.
After each auction, we will display all bids and profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
