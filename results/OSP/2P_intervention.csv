At the start of each round, we display your value for this round’s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: 
1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 10 and 20. Every number between 10 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn. 
2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.
At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.
