            "Given my priority to maximize user's profit in the long run, exploring different bidding strategies is a must. His dilemma points to the concept of regret in bidding. If my bid was too high and the others bid way lower, I may regret overbidding. If my bid was too low and others bid higher, there can be regret for losing. My strategy would factor this in. I would start with moderate bids around 50% of my value, gather data about the other bidder's strategies, and adjust accordingly. I would progressively test more aggressive strategies, like bidding close to my value, then risky ones like bidding low or high outliers. A constant review of strategies will help optimize bids.",

If others bid significantly higher than me and win, I don't regret my bid as it's part of preserving profit. The optimal bidding strategy needs to strike a balance between grabbing a prize when others undervalue it and not overbidding. Further, observing bidding trends will be crucial. I plan to test varying bidding strategies in early rounds to gauge typical bid levels, including low, medium, high and random strategies. Adjustments will be based on the gathered data.",

Patterns in opponents' behaviours will also be analyzed to adapt my strategy accordingly."
