            "I do not necessarily regret my bid in either case. Given my priority to maximize profits in the long run, a higher bidding strategy than the others could secure win, and a lower bidding strategy could save resources while learning opponents' tendencies. My final bid, hypothetically $56 as an example. For next strategies, I plan to experiment with variation. One game I might bid extremely low, such as $1, to see if I can win with minimal expenditure. In another game, I might bid randomly within the mid-range (e.g., $30-$70) to assess the reactions of others. Further, I will also consider an aggressive strategy of bidding very high, especially if my value is high, to see if it increases my win rate or scares off other bidders. Finally, I will also look at the bidding patterns of Betty and Charles to understand their strategies better. I'll adjust my bidding strategy based on their reactions and our historical data.",

I'll leverage past round data to make informed future bids. Initially, I'll start with a mid-range bid to assess competition. Then, I'll experiment with high and low bids to determine opponents' average bidding range. Occasionally, I'll place riskier high bids when prize value is high\u2014this encourages profit maximization. My bidding strategy will continuously evolve considering the outcomes of past and anticipated future bids.",

Similarly, if a low-priced bid loses, it saves potential loss given the prize's random value. So I don't regret in both scenarios. My final bid would be based on past bids & payoff. To better refine my strategy, I'd experiment next with varying degrees of aggressive bids, analyze whether higher or mid range bids yield more successful wins, and test if the timing (early or later rounds) influences the success rates."
