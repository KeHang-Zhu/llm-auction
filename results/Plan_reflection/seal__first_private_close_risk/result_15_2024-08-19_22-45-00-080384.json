Alternatively, if I'm winning with a wide margin too often, I would lower my bid to increase profit per win. I may also test hyper-aggressive bids to gauge response. In each case, regret is minimized by data-driven adjustments after each round. Intention is not just to win, but maximize profit over time by identifying optimal bid range.",

Sometimes, I bid slightly higher than my true value to take advantage of situations where the other bidders bid way lower. Other times, I bid my true value or slightly lower, to see potential profits if they bid way higher. Not all bids will give me immediate profit, however, by taking risks and learning from my bid history, I can maximize my long-term profit. I won't regret my bid because it's part of my strategic data gathering.",

If others bid higher, the risk was high that I may have paid more than I valued the prize. For future bidding strategies, I'll evaluate the patterns of Andy and Betty's bids. If they consistently bid high, I may respond with more conservative bids. Conversely, if they bid low, I may increase my bids.
