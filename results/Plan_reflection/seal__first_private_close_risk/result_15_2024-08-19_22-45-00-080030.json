If they bid way higher than me, I may miss out on a possible win but safeguard from possible losses. My strategy will focus on adaptive learning, starting with a modest bid, say $50. I will observe the bidding trends of the others for a few rounds, then place riskier, aggressive bids if I gauge they are conservative. I will iteratively refine my strategy based on win-loss outcomes to strike a balance between risk and reward.",

Then, I'll gradually reduce my bidding amount to explore the range of my opponents. In rounds where my allocated value is high, I considering bidding towards the higher end. While, during a less important round, I'd bid lower and analyze their bidding patterns. Concerning potentially regretting my bid, I understand that a bid too low or too high might not maximize profits, but it's a learning step to improve my strategy.",

However, for maximizing long-term profits, this regret is an integral part of the learning process to refine my bidding strategy. Initial rounds will involve experimental bids across the spectrum ($0-99) to gather data about other bidders' behaviors. You may lose or win bids initially, but this will be crucial for formulating the optimal bidding strategy, which would involve considering bidding patterns, prediction of other bidders\u2019 bids based on their past behavior, and my value for the prize."
