For my future plan, I'll test mean, aggressive, and defensive strategies.

However, if others bid much higher, I might regret not bidding higher if the value is significant to me. My bidding strategy will revolve around data-gathering first, making average, below average and aggressive bids to gauge competitors' tendencies. I will adjust my bids based on this information. Subsequently, I could employ a strategy of bidding the mid-point if competitors tend to bid very high or low or follow a bold strategy if my value is high.",

My strategy evolves around bidding slightly over the average of my previous values. This ensures a balance between risk and potential revenue. If I notice a pattern of aggressive bids, I adapt by increasing my bid marginally. My strategy also accounts for dynamically adjusting bids based on my competitors' previous performances. Remember, maximizing profit long-term is not about winning every time, but optimizing learning from each round."
