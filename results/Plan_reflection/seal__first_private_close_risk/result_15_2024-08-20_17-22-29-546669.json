If others bid much lower and I win, it\u2019s part of my strategy to test different bid levels for data-gathering, at potentially high profit but also high risks. If others bid way higher and I lose, I've learned about my competitors' willingness to bid high. My bidding strategy will vary in each round, based on past results.

If others bid higher and I lose, I do not regret either as my goal is long-term profit, losing a single round isn't a failure. My final bid would depend on my value, but aiming for a higher end seems reasonable. In subsequent rounds, I'd test aggressive strategies such as bidding closer to my value when it's high and safe strategies by bidding lower when it's moderate. I would also observe bidding tendencies of Andy and Charles to adjust my bid accordingly.",

As a top priority, my bidding strategies would incorporate diverse tactics to maximize profit. First, I'll analyze bidding behaviors from past rounds and adapt accordingly. Secondly, I'll be unafraid to gamble with high-risk, high-reward strategies. My final bid for this round is data-driven but encapsulates an element of unpredictability to keep competitors guessing."
