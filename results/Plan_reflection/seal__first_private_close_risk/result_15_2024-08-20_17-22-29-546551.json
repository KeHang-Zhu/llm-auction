Similarly, if others bid higher and I lose, it doesn't necessarily denote a miscalculation.

If they bid way higher, it's also not regrettable as I keep my earnings intact. For my final bid, I'll start by using my full value for higher learning and more aggressive play style. Moving ahead, I'll test strategies such as bidding exactly half or lower than my value, considering the probability of winning. Also, I'll make a note of my competitors' bidding trends and divide by the number of opponents for my bid. However, my strategies will constantly evolve based on changes in the game.",
