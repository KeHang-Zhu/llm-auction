            "Plan: Maintain 95% bidding for items over $800. For items $400-$800, slightly raise to 70-80% bid strategy. Increase competition for low-value items with an aggressive 50-60% bid. Continue analyzing competitors' patterns with occasional low bids on high-value items. Start to introduce unexpected high bids on low-value items to further confuse competitors. Aim for long-term profit based on bidding history insights. Refine and customize percentage bid according to item value.",
            "Plan: Maintain maximal bids up to $750 when value is over $900. For values below $100, bid around $50. Slightly increase bids when value ranges $600-$700. For values between $300-$600, raise bids up to 65% of the value to gather market response. Alternate between aggressive and moderate bids specifically for $400-$550 range. Continue monitoring opponents' trends and adjust strategy accordingly.",
            "Plan: Continue observing competitors' bidding patterns, focusing on recognizing their maximum and minimum bidding ranges. Experiment by placing just slightly higher bids for moderate to high-value items to secure win and keep the spending minimal. Be conservative on low-value items to avoid overbidding. Adjust strategies by increasing or decreasing bid amounts based on the observed shifts in competitors' bidding tendencies. Consider long-term gains over short-term wins. If competitors start bidding higher, adapt by adjusting our bid proportionately. Gather data from each round to refine our bidding strategy."
