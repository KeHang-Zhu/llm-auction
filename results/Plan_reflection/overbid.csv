Learning from Andy's and Charles's patterns, I'll occasionally introduce unpredictably high or low bids to discover their responses.",True,False,False,3,4,4,2
11,Bidder Andy,38.0,36.0,"I'll consider a diverse strategy mixing low, medium, and high bids, exploit randomized bidding for unpredictability, and adjust tactically in response to competition. I'll incorporate aggressive bids slightly above my value and conservative bids below it for optimal results and capitalize on trends.",True,False,False,2,4,2,2
11,Bidder Charles,82.0,80.0,"Moving ahead, my strategy will be to diversify bids, some slightly above or below my value, depending on round's value. I'll observe previous rounds, competitors bidding and adjust accordingly. Risk management will stay crucial to my strategy, and bid adjustments will be made considering potential profits.",True,False,False,2,4,4,2
12,Bidder Betty,84.0,76.0,"I'll focus on high-risk high returns strategy, placing aggressive bids during high-value rounds. Also, I will bid slightly above average during medium to lower value rounds, still incorporating unexpected low and high bids occasionally for further data analysis.",True,False,False,1,3,2,4
13,Bidder Andy,24.0,23.0,"Continuing to refine approach based on observation; employing a mix of low-risk bids under my value, randomized bids for unpredictability, and aggressive high bids when it's reasonable. Adapting strategy according to competition, aiming for long-term profit maximization.",True,False,False,2,4,4,2
0,Bidder Charles,50.0,5.0,"I plan to experiment with a range of bids from high, medium, to low values to gauge competition and assess possible profit margins. I will first start with aggressive high bids for data collection. If unsuccessful or margins are thin, I will transition to conservative low bids, then to moderate bids based on the data and competition pattern. Through progressive learning and adjusting bid strategy, I aim to maximize profit in the long run without risking too much capital in the early stage.",True,False,False,2,4,4,2
1,Bidder Andy,98.0,97.0,"Test aggressive bidding having high values. Employ a strategy of undercutting or outbidding by $1 depending on competitors' tendencies. Also, explore randomized bids for uncertainty. Track bid patterns and adapt strategy accordingly.",True,False,False,3,4,4,4
3,Bidder Charles,90.0,82.0,"I plan to diverge into riskier bids for data collection purposes, bidding either substantially higher or lower than my value, assessing other bidders' strategies, and further refining my decisions on past results. This iterative approach could lead to optimal long-term profits.",True,False,False,2,4,4,4
4,Bidder Betty,30.0,1.0,"For values >80, bid 70-85 to test higher bidding. For 60-80, bid 50-65. For <60, bid 30-45. Analyze patterns and adjust accordingly. Occasionally, bid aggressively to gather data. Goal is to maximize profit, taking calculated risks.",True,False,False,2,3,4,2
6,Bidder Charles,30.0,26.0,"I plan to test a strategy of bidding slightly above the median of previous winning bids. Additionally, when I have high values, I will explore more aggressive bidding to capture maximum profit. Understanding bidder behavior from prior rounds will be instrumental in shaping these strategies.",True,False,False,3,3,4,2
8,Bidder Charles,99.0,97.0,"My strategy involves bid oscillation between aggressive and conservative levels, informed by historical bidding patterns. I will experiment with bidding slightly above and slightly below my value, enabling adaptability. I aim to maximize profits through intelligent risk-taking and continual learning from competitors' tendencies and previous outcomes.",True,False,False,2,4,4,2
9,Bidder Andy,57.0,56.0,"In coming rounds, continue diversifying bids. High-risk high bids when value is high, low cautious bids for low values, and occasional random bids ensure unpredictability. Keep learning from competition, adapt accordingly, and keep revising bidding techniques incrementally for long-term profit maximization.",True,False,False,2,4,4,2
10,Bidder Betty,40.0,7.0,"Plan to bid 80-90 for >90 value, 60-75 for 70-90, 35-55 for <70. Adjust based on opponents' patterns. Occasionally, bid aggressively on lower values for data gathering. Aim for profit maximization with calculated risks.",True,False,False,2,3,4,2
11,Bidder Charles,44.0,3.0,"Continuing to optimize profit, I'll experiment bidding around median of historic winning bids. I'll evaluate risk with higher bids when my value is high. With lower values, I'll explore modest underbidding to learn more about competitors' bidding patterns, aiding future strategic decisions.",True,False,False,2,3,4,2
13,Bidder Betty,45.0,40.0,"Next, I'll adjust my bids according to my value: For >90, bid 85-95; for 70-90, bid 60-80; for <70, bid 30-50. Occasionally, bid low on high values for data gathering and potential profit. Analyze opponents' strategies; the key is balancing risk and profit maximization.",True,False,False,2,3,3,2
14,Bidder Betty,35.0,30.0,"For values >90, bid 80-95. For 70-90, bid 60-75. For <70, bid 30-50. Assess opponents' patterns; balance aggressive and cautious bids. Selectively bid lower on high values for data gathering, keeping risk and profit maximization in mind.",True,False,False,2,3,4,2
