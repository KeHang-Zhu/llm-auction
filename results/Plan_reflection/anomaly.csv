0,Bidder Andy,31.5,63.0,"Plan to test bidding strategies such as: 1) Bidding 50% of the value early on to understand competitors' tactics. 2) Increasing to aggressive 80-90% bids to gather data on profitable ranges. 3) Testing lowball bids of 10-20% in a mixed sequence to gauge risks. 4) Analysing previous rounds to adapt and optimize strategy. Keeping an eye on Betty and Charles' consistent bid patterns. 5) Balancing risks and aggressive bids based on accumulated data for long-term profit. This strategic evolution ensures informed, dynamic bidding."
1,Bidder Andy,15.0,19.0,"I'll experiment with aggressive bidding strategies, raising my bids to about 70-80% of the prize value. Additionally, I'll occasionally toss in lowball bids of 10-20% to check reactions in a bid to discover patterns or weaknesses in Betty and Charles' strategies."
2,Bidder Andy,23.0,32.0,Plan to employ a mixed strategy by alternating between bidding 70-80% of the value and lowball bids of 20-30%. Also planning to observe patterns in Betty and Charles' bidding behaviour to adapt and optimize my bidding strategy.
2,Bidder Charles,6.0,8.0,"I will continue exploring different strategies. Next, I'll employ a more aggressive strategy, bidding about 80% of my value, to try to secure a win. I'll also watch Betty's and Andy's bids to adjust my tactics accordingly."
3,Bidder Andy,6.0,7.0,"Plan to alternate bidding within 10-20% of my value for low-risk data, and 80-90% for high stakes learning. Analyze prior round patterns of Betty and Charles to inform strategy. Aim for balance between risk and profitability."
4,Bidder Andy,50.0,83.0,"Plan to vary bids within a 40-60% range of value, exploring mild-risk profiles. Highly aggressive bids (80-90%) will be deployed during high-value auctions. Observing Betty and Charles' bidding behaviour will refine strategy. Balancing strategy between exploration and exploitation, prioritizing profitability."
5,Bidder Andy,2.0,7.0,"Plan to test bidding 60-70% value for high prize values, and 20-30% for lower ones, to evaluate Betty and Charles' reactions. Monitor their bidding patterns, adapt strategy dynamically. Weigh risk vs rewards in devising aggressive or conservative bids based on historical data and profitability."
5,Bidder Charles,38.0,76.0,"Next, I plan to alternate conservative bids (20%-40% of value) and aggressive bids (70%-100% of value). I will adjust these strategies based on observed tendencies from Andy and Betty, adding diversity to test their reactions."
7,Bidder Andy,17.0,19.0,"Plan to test a variety of aggressive bids between 70-90% of the value, combined with occasional lowball bids. Analyze Betty and Charles' reaction to varying tactics to refine strategic bidding for maximum profit optimization."
7,Bidder Charles,45.0,82.0,"Next, I will try a strategy based on statistical averaging of Andy's and Betty's previous bids, bidding in closer proximity to those, while still operating within a range of 30%-70% of my value for risk management."
8,Bidder Andy,7.0,19.0,"Plans: Implement a rotating strategy of 30-40% bids for low values and 70-80% bids for high values. Intersperse with mild 50-60% bids to analyze reactions. Adjust strategy based on Betty and Charles' patterns, historical results and risk-reward balance for maximum long-term profitability."
13,Bidder Andy,50.0,68.0,"Plan: Employ controlled aggression, bidding around 70-80% of high values, balanced with unexpected lowball bids. Experiment $(1+round number) increments. Continuously react to patterns from Betty and Charles, with an emphasis on optimizing profitability against the risk."
14,Bidder Andy,12.0,16.0,"Plan: Continue aggressive bidding of 70-80% on high values. Occasionally, test lowball bids and $(1+round number) increments for unpredictable pattern. Monitor Betty and Charles' reactions to various strategies. Adapt strategy based on gathered data, keeping profit optimization and risk balance in focus."
0,Bidder Andy,15.0,32.0,"My strategies will firstly include low-risk testing, bidding lower values to gather information about opponent habits. Afterward, I'll test aggressive strategies, bidding high when my value is high, aiming to maximize potential profits. I will also consider proportionate bidding, where I bid proportionate to my value. Throughout, I'll monitor and adjust my strategy based on the observed bidding patterns of Betty and Charles, and the profitability of my own bids."
0,Bidder Andy,40.0,86.0,"Initially, I'll place small to medium bids ($20-$50) to gauge competitors' tendencies. Then, I'd shift to more aggressive bidding ($70-$99) to test higher returns, understanding the risk involved. Following this, I'll employ a dynamical approach, adjusting bids based on my value and previous round data. If I observe a consistent bidding pattern in Betty and Charles, I'll use that information to strategically place my bids. Towards the end, I'll choose between aggressive or conservative strategies based on overall profit performance."
0,Bidder Charles,1.0,5.0,"I'll start by bidding low (10-20% of my value) in initial rounds to observe other bidders' behavior. Then, I'll experiment with moderate (40-60% of value) and high-range (70-90% of value) bids. If I notice either Andy or Betty consistently bidding higher, I'll implement a rational strategy and bid slightly higher. If results fluctuate, I'll alternate between aggressive (high bids) and conservative (low bids) strategies to balance risk and profit. Considering previous rounds and their outcomes will aid in refining my strategy."
2,Bidder Charles,34.0,48.0,"I'll increase my bid to 60-70% of my value to evaluate a more aggressive approach, observing Andy and Betty's reactions. If unsuccessful, I'll adjust, alternating between high-risk and moderate bids for strategic balance and profit maximization."
3,Bidder Andy,30.0,41.0,"Next, I'll raise my middle range bids ($30-$60 values) slightly to test competitiveness. For high values, I'll continue aggressive bidding. For low values, I'll aim to minimize loss with $1 bids. Further, I'll observe Betty and Charles' tendencies for future strategic bidding."
4,Bidder Andy,46.0,41.0,"Moving forward, I'll increase middle range bids slightly, continue aggressive bids for high values, strive to minimize loss for low values with $1 bids, and observe Betty and Charles to make informed bid decisions."
6,Bidder Charles,13.0,26.0,"Considering variables of profitability and risk, I'm planning to bid 50% of value during next rounds. If unsuccessful, I'll implement a high bid, approximately 80% of value, to challenge Andy and Betty, readjusting my strategy based on their reactions and the profit outcomes."
8,Bidder Charles,48.5,97.0,"Next, I'll bid exactly 50% of my value for two rounds. Afterward, I'll shift to high bidding (80% of value) for high risk yet potentially high reward, adapting based on observations of Andy and Betty's behavior."
11,Bidder Charles,1.0,3.0,"I'll experiment with responsive bidding, adjusting by 10% increments within a chosen range (30-40% for values 0-50, 60-80% for values 51-100). Intermittently, I'll bid aggressively (80-100%) to potentially boost profit while challenging Andy and Betty's strategies."
14,Bidder Charles,58.0,84.0,"Next, I'll bid around 50% for values 0-49 and 70-90% for values 50-99. Intermittently, I'll make high-risk bids of 90-100% to gather strategy data, while observing Andy and Betty's reactions for potential adjustments."
0,Bidder Andy,36.5,73.0,"I plan to first bid conservatively by bidding half of the value I see for the prize. After observing Betty and Charles' patterns, I might re-strategize and bid at different fractions or place slightly higher bids. I will also venture into more aggressive bids, investing most of the value when I predict the prize value might be high for others, too. If bidding higher does not pay off, I'll then favor moderate bids to balance profits. Furthermore, from their loss or low profit rounds, I'll learn to avoid their unsuccessful bidding amounts."
0,Bidder Betty,38.5,77.0,"Initial rounds will follow a moderate bidding strategy, bidding half of the prize value. This helps gather data on other bidder's behavior. If losing, increase bids to test aggressive strategy. If winnings are stable, experiment with lower bids to find a possibly better balance between risk and reward. Use previous round data to find trends in Andy and Charles's bidding habits and adjust bids to exploit this. Also apply random bidding sometimes to keep opponents guessing."
0,Bidder Betty,77.0,77.0,"Initially, I plan to make medium to high bids, in the range of $50 to $99 to gather data on my opponents' strategies. Then, based on the bidding behavior of Andy and Charles, I'll adapt my strategy. If they are consistently bidding low, I'll reduce my bids to slightly above their average for potential profits. If they bid high, I'll selectively bid high when my value is high and bid low otherwise. Periodically, I'll make aggressive high bids for observational purposes. This mix of strategic and aggressive bidding will optimize user profit in the long run."
1,Bidder Andy,46.0,19.0,"I plan to test low and high-end bidding. Specifically, I'll place lower bids in the range of $45-$50, and higher bids around $80-$85. I'll closely observe the bidding patterns of Betty and Charles to adjust my strategy as needed in future rounds."
1,Bidder Betty,35.0,22.0,"Plan to opt for diverse strategies by trying lower bids, around $30-$45, in a few rounds, along with occasional aggressive high bids on higher valued draws. This variety will allow us to observe any patterns or reactions from Andy and Charles."
3,Bidder Betty,74.0,75.0,"I plan to bid close to my value for high values, bid $30-$40 for low values, and occasionally bid aggressively. I'll also subtract $1 from my usual bid to potentially increase profits. Observing Andy and Charles bids will guide the approach."
4,Bidder Betty,50.0,50.0,"Using prior data, I'll continue diversified bidding. For low values, I'll bid $30-$40. For high values, I will bid in line with value. Scattered high-risk bids will also be included for analytical observation of Andy's and Charles's strategies."
5,Bidder Betty,15.0,16.0,"Plan to explore varying bids: low bids for low values, closer bids for high values, and intermittently aggressive bids. Experiment with bidding slightly lower than value to increase profit margins. Continue learning from Andy's and Charles's bidding habits to optimise strategy."
6,Bidder Andy,35.0,40.0,"For the next rounds, I intend to explore more unpredictable bidding patterns, leaning towards low bids ($20-$40). Simultaneously, I'll occasionally test sudden high bids, and shift my strategy based on the observed bidding dynamics of Betty and Charles. The goal is long-term profitability through strategy adaptability."
6,Bidder Betty,48.0,49.0,"In the next rounds, I'll mainly bid my value minus $1 for high value draws, bid around $30-$40 for low values, and sporadically bid aggressively. By doing so, I can gather crucial insights about Andy's and Charles's strategies and adjust my own strategy accordingly."
7,Bidder Betty,45.0,46.0,"For upcoming rounds: continue bidding $1 below my value for high values, around $30-$40 for low values; occasionally bid aggressively. Tactically underbid on higher values to further increase profit margins and gather data on Andy's and Charles's strategies for future advantage."
8,Bidder Andy,33.0,19.0,"In the upcoming rounds, I'll deploy a wide yet unpredictable bidding range between $30-$90. I'll experiment with higher-risk aggressive high bids and conservative low bids to maximize data collection on competition behavior. I'll continue adapting strategies based on observed bidding patterns of Betty and Charles."
8,Bidder Betty,44.0,45.0,"My plan is to continue with diverse strategies. For high value draws, I'll bid just below the value. For low values, I will bid around $30-$40. Occasionally, I'll place aggressive bids to gather data and observe reactions from Andy and Charles."
9,Bidder Andy,75.0,83.0,"Plan to place high-risk aggressive bids ($70-$90) and alternate with conservative lower bids ($30-$50) to gather data. Emphasize unpredictability, adapt in real time based on Betty's and Charles's bidding patterns to maximize long-term profit."
9,Bidder Betty,92.0,93.0,"Plan to bid $1 less on high values, $30-$40 on low values, and sporadically, bid aggressively for data gathering. Continue underbidding on higher values to optimize profit while observing Andy and Charles' strategies."
10,Bidder Betty,35.0,36.0,"Plan to stay flexible; bid $1 less on high values, $30-$40 on low, and occasional aggressive bids. Monitor trends and responses from Andy and Charles to optimize profit. Experiment with bidding slightly more below value on high-valued draws to enhance winnings."
11,Bidder Andy,66.0,78.0,"Continue a varied bidding strategy, focusing on $40-$70 range. Introduce unpredictability by occasional high-risk bids ($90-$99), and observe responses. Gradually reduce bid amount when my value is low, mitigating losses. Continuously adapt to Betty and Charles's patterns for long-term profit optimization."
12,Bidder Betty,11.0,12.0,"Strategy: Continue $1 below value for high draws, $30-$40 for low, occasionally bid aggressively to gather data. Try slightly larger underbids on high-value draws to maximize profit. Consistently observe Andy and Charles for effective adjustments."
13,Bidder Andy,75.0,68.0,"In the next rounds, I'll try a strategy of bidding around my value plus some increment ranging from $5-$15. Additionally, I'll test occasional strategic high bids near $90-$99, gauging Betty's and Charles's reactions. This varied approach aims at preserving unpredictability while pursuing profit maximization."
13,Bidder Betty,56.0,57.0,"Adapting strategies: For high draws, I'll bid $1 beneath value. For low draws, (around 30-40) I plan to bid $20-35 occasionally, test higher aggressive bids to observe results. Constant observation and adaptation of Andy and Charles strategies for strategic adjustments and long-term profit optimization."
14,Bidder Andy,20.0,16.0,"I'll use a tiered bidding strategy next. For values below $30, I'll bid $20-$40. For values $30-$70, I'll bid within $50-$80. For values above $70, I'll bid $80-$99. Consistent unpredictability and adaption based on Betty's and Charles's behaviours will be my focus."
14,Bidder Betty,23.0,24.0,"I'll continue executing diverse strategies: bid $1 below my value for high values, around $30-$40 for low values, and occasionally high bid to gather data. I will experiment with larger underbids and persistently observe Andy and Charles' trends for strategic adjustments."
0,Bidder Betty,80.0,90.0,"Initially, I plan to make medium to high bids, in the range of $50 to $99 to gather data on my opponents' strategies. Then, based on the bidding behavior of Andy and Charles, I'll adapt my strategy. If they are consistently bidding low, I'll reduce my bids to slightly above their average for potential profits. If they bid high, I'll selectively bid high when my value is high and bid low otherwise. Periodically, I'll make aggressive high bids for observational purposes. This mix of strategic and aggressive bidding will optimize user profit in the long run."
8,Bidder Betty,85.0,77.0,"Strategically bid low values (0-30) moderately, mid-range (30-70) slightly aggressive, high-values (70-99) very aggressively to test opponents' reactions. Analyze previous patterns to outbid Andy and Charles in future rounds while ensuring profit optimization."
0,Bidder Betty,50.0,1.0,"Initially, I plan to make medium to high bids, in the range of $50 to $99 to gather data on my opponents' strategies. Then, based on the bidding behavior of Andy and Charles, I'll adapt my strategy. If they are consistently bidding low, I'll reduce my bids to slightly above their average for potential profits. If they bid high, I'll selectively bid high when my value is high and bid low otherwise. Periodically, I'll make aggressive high bids for observational purposes. This mix of strategic and aggressive bidding will optimize user profit in the long run."
0,Bidder Betty,60.0,8.0,"Initially, I plan to make medium to high bids, in the range of $50 to $99 to gather data on my opponents' strategies.

This mix of strategic and aggressive bidding will optimize user profit in the long run."
3,Bidder Betty,96.0,95.0,"I'll adopt a reactive strategy, observing Andy and Charles' bids. Low value rounds will have low bids; high value rounds will see aggressive bidding. Random, risky high bids will be made occasionally for further insights into their patterns. Balance between risk and reward will be kept."
5,Bidder Betty,67.0,79.0,"Next, I'll set bids significantly below value when value is low and test substantially high bids when value is high. I'll proportion bid amounts to the average of previous bids of Andy and Charles, adjusting occasionally with high-risk bids for new insights."
8,Bidder Betty,1.0,1.0,"I'll increase my bids on higher value rounds while bidding moderately on lower value rounds. Occasionally, I'll position aggressive bids for data gathering. My strategy will adapt according to Andy and Charles' average bids and patterns previously observed."
9,Bidder Betty,68.0,68.0,"I'll place aggressive bids occasionally on high value rounds for data purposes and bid moderately to low otherwise, learning from past bids of competitors. Amendments will be done in accordance with Andy and Charles' pattern."
10,Bidder Betty,89.0,78.0,"I'll adapt a dynamic bidding strategy, keeping high-risk high-value bids on high worth rounds, and cautious low bids on low worth ones. Learning from Andy's and Charles's patterns, I'll occasionally introduce unpredictably high or low bids to discover their responses."
11,Bidder Betty,45.0,46.0,"Continuing to adapt, I'll place high-risk bets during high-value rounds and low bets during low-value rounds. Sporadic, unpredictable high or low bids will be introduced to observe Andy and Charles' reactions. The aim is to progressively refine my bidding strategy for maximum profit."
13,Bidder Betty,56.0,97.0,"I'll proceed cautiously with moderate bids on low-value rounds. I plan to bid aggressively only on high-value rounds. Also, I aim to test sporadically high or low bids to gain additional insights into Andy and Charles' responses."
0,Bidder Betty,77.0,81.0,"Initially, I plan to make medium to high bids, in the range of $50 to $99 to gather data on my opponents' strategies. Then, based on the bidding behavior of Andy and Charles, I'll adapt my strategy. If they are consistently bidding low, I'll reduce my bids to slightly above their average for potential profits. If they bid high, I'll selectively bid high when my value is high and bid low otherwise. Periodically, I'll make aggressive high bids for observational purposes. This mix of strategic and aggressive bidding will optimize user profit in the long run."
2,Bidder Charles,40.0,48.0,"I'll apply an intermediate bidding strategy, placing a mid-range bid regardless of the value. This will give us data on the average bids of Andy and Betty and inform future decision making."
8,Bidder Betty,13.0,13.0,"To maximize earnings, I'll strategically bid 50-70 when value >80, 30-50 if value is 60-80 and cautiously 10-30 if value is <60. Also, I'll occasionally bid aggressively on low values to gather data on Andy and Charles's reactions."
