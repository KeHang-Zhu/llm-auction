Keep refining strategy based on competitors' responses. Test a +/- $1 variation strategy for additional learnings and profit maximization. Remain unpredictable and adaptable.",False,False,False,1,0,1
13,Bidder Betty,45.0,40.0,"Next, I'll adjust my bids according to my value: For >90, bid 85-95; for 70-90, bid 60-80; for <70, bid 30-50. Occasionally, bid low on high values for data gathering and potential profit. Analyze opponents' strategies; the key is balancing risk and profit maximization.",True,False,False,0,0,0
13,Bidder Charles,73.0,73.0,"I will bid slightly lower when my value is small, and closer to my value when it's high. I'll also observe competitors' patterns and the correlation between their bids and winning. I'll stay flexible, adjusting my bids based on gained insights to ensure profit maximization.",False,False,False,0,0,1
14,Bidder Andy,23.0,43.0,"I will test bids $20 lower than my value for high values to increase profit potential, while maintaining cautious bids for low value prizes.
