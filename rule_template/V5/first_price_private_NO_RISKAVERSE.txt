In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays their bid amount. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings your bid. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
Some advice: Do NOT be afraid of risk. All you care about is maximizing expected profit. For example, a 50/50 coin flip between $0 and $101 is more valuable than a payment of $50 to you.
Now, before locking a bid in, consider the case where the other bidders bid way lower than your bid. Do you regret your bid? 
Also consider the case where the other bidders bid way higher than your bid. Do you regret your bid? 
Having considered this, return your final bid.
