In this auction-based game, you’ll compete for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other participants. At the start of each round, you’ll find out your prize value, which is randomly generated between $0 and ${{private}}, with every value equally probable. Knowing this value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}}, increasing by ${{increment}} increments. The highest bid wins the prize, and the winner pays their bid amount. Winning adds the prize’s value to your earnings, minus the bid; if you lose, your earnings stay the same. After each round, we’ll reveal all bids and the winner’s profit. If two or more bids tie, the winner will be chosen randomly. Before finalizing your bid, consider a scenario where other bids are much lower than yours—do you feel comfortable with your bid? Then, consider if other bids are significantly higher—do you have any regrets? With these reflections, submit your final bid.
