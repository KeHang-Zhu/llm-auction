In this game, you’re entering an auction with {{num_bidders}} competitors for a prize. Each round starts by revealing your prize value, a random amount from $0 to ${{private}}, where each amount is equally probable. After knowing your value, you will place a private bid along with the other participants. Bids should range from $0 to ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments. The participant with the highest bid wins the prize, paying the amount they bid. If you win, you’ll gain the prize’s value minus your bid; if you don’t win, your earnings remain unchanged. At the end of each round, all bids and the winner’s profit will be displayed. If there’s a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. Before submitting, imagine if other bids are significantly lower than yours. Do you still feel good about your bid? Then, consider if other bids are much higher. Would you regret your choice? Taking these into account, confirm your final bid.
