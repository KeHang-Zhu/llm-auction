You are about to participate in an auction game with {{num_bidders}} other players, bidding for a prize that may hold a different dollar value for each player. The game consists of {{n}} rounds, with all dollar amounts set in increments of {{increment}} USD.

At the beginning of each round, you will see your assigned prize value. If you win, you will gain this value minus the payment required. Prize values are determined as follows:
1. A common value is drawn for the group, anywhere between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}, with all values equally possible.
2. Additionally, a private adjustment for each player is drawn, ranging from 0 to {{private}}, with equal probability for all values.
The prize value you see is based on the common value, though you won’t know the specific common or private adjustments. This causes each player to have a potentially unique prize perception.

Auction rules: First, you observe your perceived prize value, then submit a bid privately and simultaneously with other players. Bids must fall between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, in {{increment}} USD increments. The highest bidder wins, paying the second-highest bid and adding the common value minus this payment to their earnings. Other bidders’ earnings remain unchanged.
