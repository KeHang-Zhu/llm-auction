This game is an auction where you’ll be bidding against {{num_bidders}} other players to win a prize. Each round, you’ll see your assigned prize value, randomly selected between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely. Once you know this value, you will privately submit a bid alongside the other bidders. Bids should range from $0 to ${{private}}, in steps of ${{increment}}. The highest bid wins the prize, with the winner paying their bid amount. If you win, your prize value will be added to your earnings, minus the bid. If you lose, your earnings remain as they are. At the close of each auction, we’ll show the bids and the profit of the winner. In case of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly. Before deciding, think about what would happen if other bids were much lower than yours—would you regret your bid? And if other bids were much higher—would you reconsider your bid? After thinking through these, confirm your final bid.
