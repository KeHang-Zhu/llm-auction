In this auction, you will compete against {{num_bidders}} others to bid on a prize that may have a unique dollar value for each participant. This game will be played over {{n}} rounds, with all amounts set in increments of {{increment}} USD.

At the start of each round, you’ll be shown your prize value for that round. Winning the prize nets you its value, minus the amount paid in the auction. Here’s how prize values are calculated:
1. Each group’s common value is drawn within the range {{common_low}} to {{common_high}}, with each number equally probable.
2. Each player’s private adjustment is drawn independently, between 0 and {{private}}, with equal probability across that range.
The displayed prize value includes the common value, but you won’t know the exact common value or adjustment. This results in different prize perceptions across players.

Auction flow: First, you observe your prize value for that round, then submit a private bid alongside the other players. Bids must range between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}} in increments of {{increment}} USD. The top bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid, earning the common prize value minus that amount. Other players’ earnings do not change.
