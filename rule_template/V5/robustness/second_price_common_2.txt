In this auction, you will compete with {{num_bidders}} others for a prize, where the prize's dollar value may differ for each player. You will participate for {{n}} rounds, with all bids and payments made in increments of {{increment}} USD.

Each round begins by revealing your value for the prize. If you win, you earn this prize value minus your bid. Here’s how prize values are set:
1. A common value is chosen for your group, falling between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Any number within this range has an equal chance of selection.
2. A private adjustment is also drawn for each player, ranging from 0 to {{private}}, with each value equally likely.
Your total prize value each round equals the common value, but you will only see your full prize value without knowing the common or private adjustments. Consequently, each player may perceive a unique prize value.

Auction process: You’ll view your (perceived) prize value first, then submit a private bid along with the others. All bids must be within {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, in increments of {{increment}} USD. The highest bidder wins, paying the second-highest bid amount. Their earnings equal the common prize value minus this payment, while others’ earnings stay the same.
