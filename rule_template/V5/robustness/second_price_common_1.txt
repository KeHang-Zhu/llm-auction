In this auction game, you will place bids against {{num_bidders}} other participants to try to win a prize. The prize's dollar value may vary for each player. This game will last for {{n}} rounds, with all amounts set in increments of {{increment}} USD.

At the start of each round, your prize value for that round will be displayed. If you win the auction, you will earn this value minus your payment. The prize value calculation works as follows:
1. A common value is drawn for each group, ranging between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}, with every value in this range equally likely.
2. Each player receives a private adjustment, drawn between 0 and {{private}}, where every amount in that range is equally likely.
In each round, your prize value is based on the common value, but you will only see your total prize value, not the common value or your adjustment. This means each player may perceive a different prize value.

Auction details: First, you’ll see your (perceived) prize value. Then, you’ll submit your bid alongside others, privately and simultaneously. Bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}} in increments of {{increment}} USD. The top bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid, receiving the prize’s common value minus that bid. The other players' earnings remain unchanged.
