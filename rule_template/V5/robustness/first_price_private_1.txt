In this auction game, you will compete for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. At the beginning of each round, you will see your value for the prize, randomly chosen between $0 and ${{private}}, with each amount being equally likely. Once you've learned your value, you’ll place a bid privately at the same time as everyone else. Your bid must be between $0 and ${{private}}, increasing in steps of ${{increment}}. The highest bid wins the prize, with the winner paying the bid amount. This means, if you win, your earnings will increase by the prize's value but decrease by the bid amount. If you don’t win, your earnings stay the same. After each round, you’ll see all bids and the winner’s profit. In case of a tie for the highest bid, the winner will be selected randomly. Now, think about the possibility of other bidders bidding much lower than you. Do you feel confident about your bid? Also consider if other bidders bid much higher. Do you regret your decision? With these scenarios in mind, submit your final bid.
