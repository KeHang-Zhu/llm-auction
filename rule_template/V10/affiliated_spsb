In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in {{increment}} increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this roundâ€™s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. For each group, a common value will be drawn, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn.
2. For each person, a private adjustment will be drawn, which will be between 0 and {{private}}. Every number between 0 and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
In each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, which is a sum of the common value and your private adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private adjustment separately.
This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time.
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
