In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.

**FIRST STAGE: Sealed Bid**
You will submit a sealed bid privately at the same time as the other bidders.
The value you bid now will serve as your automatic exit price in the next stage.

**SECOND STAGE: Ascending Clock (Blind)**
After the sealed bid stage, an ascending clock will start.
The clock will start at ${{min_price}} and increase in increments of ${{incerement}}.
The clock will display the current price. You will also see that there are a total of {{num_bidders}} bidders remaining, even if some bidders have already automatically exited. You cannot see other bidders' values.
If the current price on the clock reaches or exceeds your sealed bid from the first stage, you will automatically exit the auction.

**END OF AUCTION**
The highest bidder from the first stage who has not automatically exited from the second stage wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid amount among the bidders who have not automatically exited.
This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings the second-highest bid among bidders who have not automatically exited. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
