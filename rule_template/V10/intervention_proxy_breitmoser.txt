In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
    At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
    After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
**FIRST STAGE: Sealed Bid**
    You will submit a sealed bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. This bid will serve as your automatic exit price in the next stage.
**SECOND STAGE: Ascending Clock (Simulation)**
    After the sealed bid stage, we will simulate an ascending clock auction.
    The clock will start at $0 and increase in increments of ${{increment}}.
    The clock will display the current price. You will also see that there are a total of {{num_bidders}} bidders participating, although you do not know other bidderâ€™s values.
    If the current price on the clock reaches or exceeds your sealed bid from the first stage, you will automatically exit the auction. The auction ends when only one bidder is left remaining in the second stage based on their bid from the first stage.
**END OF AUCTION**
If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize and decrease by the clock price at the end of the auction. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
    After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
