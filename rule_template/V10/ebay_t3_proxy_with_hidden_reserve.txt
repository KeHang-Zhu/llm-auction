Item Details:
Item Description: {{item_description}}

Your Private Value: Your private value for this item is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between $0 and ${{private}}.

Auction Format:

Reserve Price: This auction has a hidden reserve price of ${{reserve_price}}. The item will not sell unless the bidding reaches this price.
Auction Duration: This auction will last for {{num_rounds}} days.

Bidding Instructions:
At each period, you will output a single numerical value which represents your maximum bid. If you do not want to increase your maximum bid in a given period, then output your previous maximum bid.
eBay uses "proxy bidding." This means you can enter your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder.
You may place bids at any point during the auction, even in the final day.
You have {{rounds_left}} periods remaining.

Auction End:
The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item, provided the reserve price has been met. The winner pays the final auction price.
If the auction ends without meeting the reserve price, the item will not be sold.
