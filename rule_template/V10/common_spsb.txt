In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in {{increment}} increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this roundâ€™s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn.
2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and {{private}}. Every number between 0 and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
In each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, which is a sum of the common value and your private adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private adjustment separately.
This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time.
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to their earnings the common value for the prize, and subtract from their earnings the second-highest bid. If there is a tie for the highest bid, we will resolve ties randomly. All other bidders' earnings will not change.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits.
