In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. 
At the start of each round, bidders will see their perceived value for the prize â€“ a noisy measurement of the true value of the prize. Your perceived value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. For each round, a common value will be drawn between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}, with all values equally likely to be drawn.
2. For each person, a private noisy adjustment will be drawn between -{{private}} and {{private}}, with all values equally likely to be drawn.
We will tell you your perceived value, the sum of the common value and the private noise adjustment. However, everyone's true value for the prize is equal to the shared common value. 
After learning your perceived value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{common_high + private}} in ${{increment}} increments. 
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by the true value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
