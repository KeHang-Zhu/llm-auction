In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in {{increment}} increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this roundâ€™s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. For each group, a common value will be drawn, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn.
2. For each person, a noisy adjustment will be drawn, which will be between -{{private}} and {{private}}. Every number between -{{private}} and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
Your true value for the good is the common value, but you can only observe a noisy measurement of that value, n
This means that in each round, everyone has a noisy measurement of the common value, where measurement error is private. 
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your total noisy measurement for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time.
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by the common value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
