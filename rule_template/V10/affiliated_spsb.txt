In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and {{private}}, with all values equally likely.
Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{common_high + private}} in ${{increment}} increments. 
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
