In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize. All bidders (including the winner) pay their submitted bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by the value for the prize, and decrease by your bid. If you don't win, your earnings will still decrease by your bid.
After each auction, we will display all bids and all bidders' profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
