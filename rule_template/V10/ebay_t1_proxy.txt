In this game, you will participate in a simulated eBay auction for a prize against an unknown number of other bidders. You will play this game for a maximum of {{num_rounds}} rounds. In each round, you can bid or hold your previous bid. All dollar amounts in this game are in US Dollars ($).

Auction Format:
Auction Type: Standard eBay-style auction with proxy bidding.

Auction Duration: This auction has a duration of {{num_rounds}} rounds.
Bid Increment: Bids must increase by at least ${{bid_increment}}.
Sniping Allowed: Bidders are allowed to place bids at any time, including the final round of the auction.

Bidding Instructions:
At each round, you will output a single numerical value which represents your bid. If you do not want to bid in a given round, then output your previous bid.
eBay uses "proxy bidding." This means you can enter your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder.
Remember: Your goal is to obtain the item for a price less than or equal to your private value. Bid strategically!
Consider that other bidders may engage in "bid sniping," placing bids in the final seconds of the auction.

Auction End:
The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item.
The winner pays the final auction price (which may be less than their maximum bid due to proxy bidding).

Important Notes:
Other bidders may have different private values for the item.
