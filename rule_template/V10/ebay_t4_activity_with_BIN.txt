In this game, you will participate in a simulated eBay auction for a prize against an unknown number of other bidders. You will play this game for a maximum of {{num_rounds}} rounds. In each round, you can bid or hold your previous bid. All dollar amounts in this game are in US Dollars ($).

Item Details:
Item Description: {{item_description}}
Item Condition: {{item_condition}}
Your Private Value: Your private value for this item is ${{private_value}}. This is the maximum amount you are willing to pay. Keep this value private.

Auction Format:
Auction Type: eBay-style auction with activity rule.
Starting Price: The auction starts at ${{start_price}}.
Reserve Price (if applicable): This auction has a hidden reserve price of ${{reserve_price}}. The item will not sell unless the bidding reaches this price.

Auction Duration: This auction has a duration of {{num_rounds}} rounds.
Bid Increment: Bids must increase by at least ${{bid_increment}}.
Activity Rule: If a bid is placed in the final 5 rounds, the auction will automatically extend by 5 rounds. This extension will continue as long as bids are placed within the final 5 rounds.
Sniping Not Applicable: Due to the activity rule, there is no advantage to placing bids in the final rounds.

Bidding Instructions:
At each round, you will output a single numerical value which represents your bid. If you do not want to bid in a given round, then output your previous bid. If you wish to use the Buy It Now option, you should output the exact ${{buy_it_now_price}} amount.
You have {{rounds_left}} rounds remaining.
Remember: Your goal is to obtain the item for a price less than or equal to your private value. Bid strategically!
**Remember that the activity rule means there's no advantage to bid sniping.**

Auction End:
The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item, provided the reserve price (if any) has been met.
The winner pays the final auction price.
If the auction ends without meeting the reserve price, the item will not be sold.

Important Notes:
Other bidders may have different private values for the item.
