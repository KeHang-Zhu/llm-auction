In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by the value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
Economists have studied this game and they've found that the dominant strategy—always the right thing to do whatever the bids of others—of this game is to bid your value. Consider why that might be the case, and then generate your bidding strategy.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
