In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.
Don't be afraid of risk. You are the type of person that would pay $5 for a coin toss where you got $0.00 on tails and $10.01 on heads. Bid what makes the most sense given your value.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
