In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in {{increment}} increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this roundâ€™s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. For each group, a common value will be drawn, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn.
2. For each person, a private adjustment will be drawn, which will be between 0 and {{private}}. Every number between 0 and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
In each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.
This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group, that starts low and counts upwards in {{increment}} USD increments, up to a maximum of {{max_price}}. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction. The starting bidding will be {{min_price}}.
When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged. 
After each auction, we will display the prices where all the bidders stopped, and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
