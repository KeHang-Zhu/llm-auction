In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and ${{private}}, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
Your “price to win” the item will be set to the highest bid placed by any other player. If your bid is higher than this “price to win,” then you will win the item and pay this price.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
