The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. 
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the secondhighest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.
At the end of each auction, we will show you the bids, ranked from highest to lowest, and the winning bidderâ€™s profits. If there is a tie for the highest bidder, the tie will be resolved randomly.
