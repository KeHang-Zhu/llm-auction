At the start of each round, we display your value for this round’s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: 
1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn. 
2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and {{private}}. Every number between 0 and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value. 
In each round, we will draw a different common value.
