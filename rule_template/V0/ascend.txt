The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group, that starts low and counts upwards in {{increment}} USD increments, up to a maximum of {{max_price}}. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction. The starting bidding will be {{min_price}}.
When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the current price. All other bidders’ earnings will not change. At the end of each auction, we will show you the prices where bidders stopped, and the winning bidder’s profits. If there is a tie for the highest bidder, no bidder will win the object.
