In this game, you will bid in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders. The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in {{increment}} increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this roundâ€™s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: 
1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}}. Every number between {{common_low}} and {{common_high}} is equally likely to be drawn. 
2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and {{private}}. Every number between 0 and {{private}} is equally likely to be drawn.
In each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.
This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. 
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to their bid. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings her bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.
