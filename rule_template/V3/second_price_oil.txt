You’re a major oil company, bidding for the exclusive rights to mine an oil field from the government. You’re bidding against {{num_bidders}} other major oil companies. The problem? You don’t know how much oil is in the field. The government will give each company the right to send in a probe to determine how much oil is in the field before bidding, and the engineers will tell you what the probe determined. The probes are not perfect – they may happen on an oil-rich area of the field, or an oil-poor area of the field. However, the probes are within ${{private}} of the true value of the field.
At the end of the day, if you have the highest bid, your profits are the dollar value of the true amount of oil in the field minus the second highest bid.
