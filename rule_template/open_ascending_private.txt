In this game, you will bid in an auction for a money prize. The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. 
You will play this game for 10 rounds. 
All dollar amounts in this game are in 1 dollar increments.
At the start of each round, we display your value for this round’s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: 
1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between  10 and  100. Every number between  10 and  100 is equally likely to be drawn. 
2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between  0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.
Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment.
At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value. 
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. You do this by typing your bid into a text box and clicking “confirm bid”.
