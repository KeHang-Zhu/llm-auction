The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. You do this by typing your bid into a text box and clicking “confirm bid”.
All bids must be between {{min_price}} and {{max_price}}, and in {{increment}} USD increments.
The highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the secondhighest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.
At the end of each auction, we will show you the bids, ranked from highest to lowest, and the winning bidder’s profits. If there is a tie for the highest bidder, no bidder will win the object.
