You will first learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction starts:
The current auction price is common knowledge, displayed to everyone in the group. It starts at {{min_price}} and increases in {{increment}} USD increments. You can leave the auction at any time, and if you leave before winning, you pay 0 and donâ€™t receive the prize. You can see when people leave. When there is one bidder left, that bidder wins the prize and pays the current auction price.
We will play multiple rounds of the auction.  Your value for the prize each round is independent from the value you get from all previous or future prizes.
