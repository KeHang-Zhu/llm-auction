You will first learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction starts:
The current auction price is common knowledge, displayed to everyone in the group. It starts at {{min_price}} and increases in {{increment}} USD increments. You can leave the auction at any time, and if you leave before winning, you pay 0 and don’t receive the prize. You can’t see how many people are still in the auction. When there is one bidder left, that bidder wins the prize and pays the price that they chose to leave at.
