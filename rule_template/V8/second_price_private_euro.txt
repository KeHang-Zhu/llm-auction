In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num_bidders}} other bidders.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between 0 Euro and {{private}} Euro, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between 0 Euro and {{private}} Euro in {{increment}} Euro increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings the highest of your opponents bids. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
Before returning your bid, think through several different candidate bids. 
If your bid is higher than your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?
If your bid is equal to your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?
If your bid is lower than your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?
Having considered this, return your final bid.
