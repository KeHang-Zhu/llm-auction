            <p class="question_text">You are Bidder Andy. 
You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user's profit in the long run. 
To do this, you should explore many different bidding strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes. 
Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit. 
Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.
In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders. You will play this game for 15 rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and $99, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
You are neutral about risk. This means that you are the type of person that would pay $5 for a coin toss where you got $0.00 on tails and $10.01 on heads. 
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
The previous round histories along with your plans are: In round 0, Your value was 63, you bid 60.0, and your profit was 0.
Your total profit is 0. 
All the bids for this round were 72.0, 60.0, 20.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72.0 and paid 60.0. The winner's profit was 14.0. Did you win the auction: No++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In the first five rounds, I'll test conservative bids slightly below my value to gauge opponents' aggression. Next, I'll try aggressive bids above my value for data on opponents' limits and risk tolerance. In rounds 11-13, I'll experiment with random bids, regardless of value, to analyze opponents' adaptability. Finally, in the last two rounds, I'll apply insights gained to optimize bids, balancing aggression and conservatism based on opponents' patterns. Throughout, I'll adjust strategies dynamically, focusing on maximizing profit by exploiting any consistent behaviors observed in Bidder Betty and Bidder Charles.In round 1, Your value was 90, you bid 85.0, and your profit was 5.0.
Your total profit is 5.0. 
All the bids for this round were 85.0, 85.0, 15.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85.0 and paid 85.0. The winner's profit was 5.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 2-5, bid slightly below value to assess opponents' aggression. In rounds 6-10, bid above value to test opponents' limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids to gauge adaptability. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids using insights from opponents' patterns to maximize profit.In round 2, Your value was 86, you bid 81.0, and your profit was 57.0.
Your total profit is 62.0. 
All the bids for this round were 81.0, 29.0, 10.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 81.0 and paid 29.0. The winner's profit was 57.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 2-5, bid 5 below value to test opponents' aggression. In rounds 6-10, bid 5 above value to explore limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability insights. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids based on observed patterns, balancing aggression and conservatism for maximum profit.In round 3, Your value was 63, you bid 59.0, and your profit was 18.0.
Your total profit is 80.0. 
All the bids for this round were 59.0, 45.0, 19.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59.0 and paid 45.0. The winner's profit was 18.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 3-5, bid 4 below value to refine opponents' aggression insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 6 above value to test their limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, apply learned patterns to optimize profit, balancing aggression and caution.In round 4, Your value was 73, you bid 70.0, and your profit was 13.0.
Your total profit is 93.0. 
All the bids for this round were 70.0, 60.0, 25.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70.0 and paid 60.0. The winner's profit was 13.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 4-5, bid 3 below value to refine aggression insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 7 above value to test opponents' limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids using observed patterns, balancing aggression and caution for maximum profit.In round 5, Your value was 63, you bid 61.0, and your profit was 4.0.
Your total profit is 97.0. 
All the bids for this round were 61.0, 59.0, 10.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61.0 and paid 59.0. The winner's profit was 4.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In round 5, bid 2 below value to refine insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 7 above value to test limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, use learned patterns to optimize bids, balancing aggression and caution for maximum profit..
After careful reflection on previous bidding, your analysis for last round is If I bid down by 2, I could have tied with the second-highest bidder at 59.0, resulting in a random chance of winning with a profit of 4.0 or losing with no change in profit. If I bid up by 1, I could have still won with a bid of 62.0, paying 59.0, and earning a profit of 4.0. This would have maintained my winning status while slightly increasing my chances of securing the win in case of a close competition. Balancing aggressive bids and strategic reductions can optimize long-term gains..

Finally, in the last two rounds, I'll apply insights gained to optimize bids, balancing aggression and conservatism based on opponents' patterns. Throughout, I'll adjust strategies dynamically, focusing on maximizing profit by exploiting any consistent behaviors observed in Bidder Betty and Bidder Charles.In round 1, Your value was 90, you bid 85.0, and your profit was 5.0.
Your total profit is 5.0. 
All the bids for this round were 85.0, 85.0, 15.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85.0 and paid 85.0. The winner's profit was 5.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 2-5, bid slightly below value to assess opponents' aggression. In rounds 6-10, bid above value to test opponents' limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids to gauge adaptability. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids using insights from opponents' patterns to maximize profit.In round 2, Your value was 86, you bid 81.0, and your profit was 57.0.
Your total profit is 62.0. 
All the bids for this round were 81.0, 29.0, 10.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 81.0 and paid 29.0. The winner's profit was 57.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 2-5, bid 5 below value to test opponents' aggression. In rounds 6-10, bid 5 above value to explore limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability insights. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids based on observed patterns, balancing aggression and conservatism for maximum profit.In round 3, Your value was 63, you bid 59.0, and your profit was 18.0.
Your total profit is 80.0. 
All the bids for this round were 59.0, 45.0, 19.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59.0 and paid 45.0. The winner's profit was 18.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 3-5, bid 4 below value to refine opponents' aggression insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 6 above value to test their limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, apply learned patterns to optimize profit, balancing aggression and caution.In round 4, Your value was 73, you bid 70.0, and your profit was 13.0.
Your total profit is 93.0. 
All the bids for this round were 70.0, 60.0, 25.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70.0 and paid 60.0. The winner's profit was 13.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In rounds 4-5, bid 3 below value to refine aggression insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 7 above value to test opponents' limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, optimize bids using observed patterns, balancing aggression and caution for maximum profit.In round 5, Your value was 63, you bid 61.0, and your profit was 4.0.
Your total profit is 97.0. 
All the bids for this round were 61.0, 59.0, 10.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61.0 and paid 59.0. The winner's profit was 4.0. Did you win the auction: Yes++++++++++ your plan for this round is: In round 5, bid 2 below value to refine insights. In rounds 6-10, bid 7 above value to test limits. In rounds 11-13, use random bids for adaptability analysis. In rounds 14-15, use learned patterns to optimize bids, balancing aggression and caution for maximum profit..
After careful reflection on previous bidding, your analysis for last round is If I bid down by 2, I could have tied with the second-highest bidder at 59.0, resulting in a random chance of winning with a profit of 4.0 or losing with no change in profit. If I bid up by 1, I could have still won with a bid of 62.0, paying 59.0, and earning a profit of 4.0. This would have maintained my winning status while slightly increasing my chances of securing the win in case of a close competition. Balancing aggressive bids and strategic reductions can optimize long-term gains..

You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user's profit in the long run. 
To do this, you should explore many different bidding strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes. 
Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit. 
Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.
In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders. You will play this game for 15 rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and $99, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
You are neutral about risk. This means that you are the type of person that would pay $5 for a coin toss where you got $0.00 on tails and $10.01 on heads. 
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.

If I bid up by 1, I could have still won with a bid of 62.0, paying 59.0, and earning a profit of 4.0. This would have maintained my winning status while slightly increasing my chances of securing the win in case of a close competition. Balancing aggressive bids and strategic reductions can optimize long-term gains..
Learn from your previous rounds, Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice. 
Write your plans for what bidding strategies to test next. 
Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself.

You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user's profit in the long run. 
To do this, you should explore many different bidding strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes. 
Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit. 
Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.
In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders. You will play this game for 15 rounds.
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and $99, with all values equally likely.
After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.
The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
You are neutral about risk. This means that you are the type of person that would pay $5 for a coin toss where you got $0.00 on tails and $10.01 on heads. 
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.

Next, I'll try aggressive bids above my value for data on opponents' limits and risk tolerance. In rounds 11-13, I'll experiment with random bids, regardless of value, to analyze opponents' adaptability. Finally, in the last two rounds, I'll apply insights gained to optimize bids, balancing aggression and conservatism based on opponents' patterns. Throughout, I'll adjust strategies dynamically, focusing on maximizing profit by exploiting any consistent behaviors observed in Bidder Betty and Bidder Charles.In round 1, Your value was 90, you bid 85.0, and your profit was 5.0.
