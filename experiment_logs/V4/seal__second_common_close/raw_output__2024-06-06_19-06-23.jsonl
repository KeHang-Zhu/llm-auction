My value this round is 58, and given the history of bids around the 40s and the necessity to outbid but not grossly overpay, I choose 46 to balance winning chances with profit maximization.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 62 and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, a competitive bid is essential to secure the prize without overpaying. In round 0, the winning bid was 36, round 1 was 42, and round 2 was 64. Most bids range between the high 30s to low 60s. A bid of 50 gives me a strong chance to win while balancing the risk of paying a high second-highest bid, maximizing potential profit from the true common value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 59, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 52, 50, 50, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have been highly competitive and tend to be fairly high but without consistently ensuring a win. Given my value of 59 this round and aiming to balance risk and potential reward based on the pattern of previous winning and second-highest bids, a bid of 48 should be competitive. This strategy addresses the need to outbid others while attempting to avoid excessive overbidding which can minimize profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have been highly competitive and tend to be fairly high but without consistently ensuring a win. Given my value of 59 this round and aiming to balance risk and potential reward based on the pattern of previous winning and second-highest bids, a bid of 48 should be competitive. This strategy addresses the need to outbid others while attempting to avoid excessive overbidding which can minimize profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 12, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 24, 20, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from the mid-30s to the high 50s with highly competitive bidding. Since my value is relatively low compared to the typical winning bids, I choose to bid 18 to avoid winning and incurring a loss, while staying in the game and being prepared for any unusual lower competing bids.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, the winning bid has generally ranged from the mid-30s to the high 50s depending on competition. Bidding 37 should be competitive enough to have a fair chance of winning without overbidding, as previous second-highest bids have often been slightly lower.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 90 for the prize and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids and second-highest bids are usually determined by a competitive environment with bids often in the mid-30s to high-50s range, occasionally reaching low-60s. To maximize my profit, I need to balance my chances of winning against the cost if I do win.

In round 0, the winning bid was 36, round 1 was 42, and round 2 was 64. Most bids range between the high 30s to low 60s.

Given my value of 59 this round and aiming to balance risk and potential reward based on the pattern of previous winning and second-highest bids, a bid of 48 should be competitive.

To maximize my profit, I need to balance my chances of winning against the cost if I do win.

This bid is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while trying to ensure my profit margin remains positive based on the expected common value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50.

By bidding 47, I aim to balance a strong competitive bid with higher chances of positive profits if I win, given that past second-highest bids were often close to the winning bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 65, both past patterns and competitive behavior of other bidders, I want to place a bid that is competitive yet leaves a good profit margin. Past winning bids have been ranging from mid-30s to mid-60s, with many second-highest bids falling in the mid-40s to low-50s range. By bidding 52, I aim to balance the risk of overbidding while maintaining a strong position to win and maximize my profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round and considering the previous rounds' results where winning bids have been significantly higher than the perceived value for winning bidders, I want to be more conservative. Since my value is relatively low compared to the values I've had in previous rounds, a bid of 20 balances being competitive without overinvesting, minimizing potential losses if I don't win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36 in this round, and based on the previous rounds' data where bids tend to be competitive but often not aligning with the exact value due to variability, I aim to place a bid that is somewhat conservative yet competitive. Given the past bids ranged from mid-20s to mid-60s, a bid of 30 balances the strategy of maintaining competitiveness without risking significant losses if I win, considering the possibility of lower second-highest bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 84, I want to bid competitively while avoiding overbidding, which history suggests leads to negative profits. Previous rounds show a pattern of competitive bids around 50-60 when values are high. Thus, a bid of 60 is strategic, allowing me to maximize chances of winning while aiming for a positive profit margin based on likely second-highest bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 47 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it's clear that competitive bids often fall slightly below or above the perceived values. To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overbidding and potential losses, I choose to place a bid of 40.

A bid of 33 ensures that if I win, it's with an acceptable margin based on others possibly bidding close but slightly lower.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 60, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit while staying competitive. In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders. I want to bid enough below my value to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering that bids for winning ranged between 40-65. Therefore, a bid of 58 should allow me a good chance to win without likely overpaying.'

Historical bids show a tendency for the highest bids to be in the range of 50-60. A bid of 55 strikes a balance by being competitive enough to potentially win without overpaying.'

In previous rounds, successful bids have been around 50-60 when values were higher. With a value of 21, I estimate that a bid of 18 will give me a competitive edge while avoiding overpayment, considering the perceived values of others might also be relatively lower in this range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 41 and the history indicating a trend where highest bids have often been close to or below their perceived value, a bid of 38 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while slightly underbidding my perceived value, which should maximize my profit if I win while minimizing potential overpayment.'

To maximize my profit, I need to balance my chances of winning against the cost if I do win.

This bid is also influenced by the nature of second-highest bid payments, allowing room for profit even if I don't perfectly predict other bidders' values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 41. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 45, a strategic bid below my value but high enough to increase my chances of winning is important. Looking at the history where the highest bids were in the mid- to high-30s, bidding 38 seems reasonable to give me a competitive edge while leaving room for a potential profit by paying the second-highest bid.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 54, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 60, 50, 50, 46, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 55, and considering the history where higher bids have ranged up to the low 40s, aiming for a slightly lower bid around 50 seems strategic. This should place me as a strong contender to win while potentially allowing for a competitive secondary payment below my bid value, maximizing the chance of profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 50, 50, 48, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round is 54 and considering the history where the top bids are often in the 40s to 60s for higher values, bidding 48 strategically maximizes my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overpay. This bid is competitive but leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower than my value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, and reviewing the history where higher bids often approach the high 40s to mid-50s, bidding 50 would place me competitively to win without overbidding. This strategy considers the need to outbid others while aiming to pay a second-highest bid that still allows for a potential profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 12, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 24, 20, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 14, a strategic bid below my value but still competitive could be my best approach. The history shows that bids are often in the 40s to 50s for higher values. Since my value is significantly lower this round, bidding 12 seems reasonable. This bid increases my chances of a profit if the second-highest bid is low and helps me avoid significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round is 31 and learning from the history where winning bids often range from the mid-30s to the mid-50s, bidding 27 is strategic. It is slightly below my value to minimize the risk of overpaying but high enough to remain competitive for winning the prize at a lower cost if others bid conservatively.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 78 this round and reviewing the history where winning bids have been in the mid-30s to low-60s, I will choose a higher bid of 70 to maximize my chance of winning. Since the common value could still be lower, bidding at this level also aims to ensure I do not overpay significantly compared to my perceived value, leaving room for a potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round is 53 and analyzing the history of past bids where higher bids tend to fall in the mid-30s to high-50s for higher values, bidding 48 should place me competitively without significantly overbidding. This strategy maximizes my chances of winning while allowing for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 11 and considering past rounds where lower perceived values led to lower bids, a bid of 9 seems strategic. This is below my value, reducing the risk of overpaying if I win, and my low value suggests high competition isn\u2019t expected.

A bid of 25 should strike a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overbidding if my value is not the highest.'

Historical bids have shown that the highest winning bids have been in the range of mid 30s to mid 60s. Bidding 75 should be competitive and give a good chance of winning without bidding too high and risking a smaller profit.'

Placing a bid of 45 strikes a balance between being competitive and leaving room to ensure a profit if I win. This bid is significantly below my perceived value to maximize potential profit while being high enough to likely win more often than not.'

With a bid of 24, I aim to keep a margin based on the lower end of competitive bids in previous rounds. This approach minimizes potential losses while still giving me a chance to win if others also bid conservatively.'

My aim is to balance winning the prize with making a profit. A bid of 52 is likely to be competitive, given that previous winning bids have ranged between the mid-30s and mid-60s. This bid also leaves some margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders.

My value for the prize is 55 this round. I want to bid strategically high enough to outbid others but not significantly more than necessary. A bid of 41 should give me a good chance to win the prize without risking too much over-payment.'

My value this round is 58, and given the history of bids around the 40s and the necessity to outbid but not grossly overpay, I choose 46 to balance winning chances with profit maximization.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 62 and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, a competitive bid is essential to secure the prize without overpaying. In round 0, the winning bid was 36, round 1 was 42, and round 2 was 64. Most bids range between the high 30s to low 60s. A bid of 50 gives me a strong chance to win while balancing the risk of paying a high second-highest bid, maximizing potential profit from the true common value.'

Given my value of 59 this round and aiming to balance risk and potential reward based on the pattern of previous winning and second-highest bids, a bid of 48 should be competitive. This strategy addresses the need to outbid others while attempting to avoid excessive overbidding which can minimize profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 26 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged from the mid-30s to the high 50s with highly competitive bidding. Since my value is relatively low compared to the typical winning bids, I choose to bid 18 to avoid winning and incurring a loss, while staying in the game and being prepared for any unusual lower competing bids.'

Bidding 37 should be competitive enough to have a fair chance of winning without overbidding, as previous second-highest bids have often been slightly lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 90 for the prize and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids and second-highest bids are usually determined by a competitive environment with bids often in the mid-30s to high-50s range, occasionally reaching low-60s. To maximize my profit, I need to balance my chances of winning against the cost if I do win. By bidding 70, I strategically position myself to outbid most other competitors while still leaving a significant margin for profit given the rare but possible high second bids approaching this threshold.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37.

Bidding 37 should be competitive enough to have a fair chance of winning without overbidding, as previous second-highest bids have often been slightly lower. This strategy aims to balance the potential for winning with minimizing the risk of paying too high a price.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids have generally ranged from the mid-30s to high-50s depending on competition, with few exceptionally lower bids. Since my value is quite low this round, winning is unlikely, and overbidding would cause a loss. Therefore, bidding 6 allows me to stay in the game and also avoid unnecessary risks, optimizing my profit strategy considering the higher likely bids from other players.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 13 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it is evident that bidding has been competitive, typically with higher bids in the intermediate rounds, and lower bids when the values are less. Since any bid lower than my value keeps me in the positive profit margin if I win, and accounting for the chance to win with minimal bidders close to my value, I think bidding 9 might offer a balance between overbidding and aiming to secure the prize with positive profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 24 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The history shows that bids are often in the 40s to 50s for higher values. Since my value is significantly lower this round, bidding 12 seems reasonable.

This is below my value, reducing the risk of overpaying if I win, and my low value suggests high competition isn\u2019t expected.

By bidding 35, I leave some margin for error considering I don't know the exact common value or the private adjustments of other bidders. This bid is competitive yet conservative, offering a decent profit if I win without overbidding.'

By bidding 42, I increase my chances of winning without significantly risking overbidding compared to other bidders' patterns from the previous round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 73 and considering the previous rounds' highest bids (36 and 42), I'll increase my bid to 50 to stay competitive and attempt to capture the prize. This bid is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while trying to ensure my profit margin remains positive based on the expected common value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value of 59 and analyzing past bidding patterns where winning bids ranged from around 36 to 64, I want to bid an amount that is competitive yet leaves room for a decent profit margin. By bidding 47, I aim to balance a strong competitive bid with higher chances of positive profits if I win, given that past second-highest bids were often close to the winning bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 65, both past patterns and competitive behavior of other bidders, I want to place a bid that is competitive yet leaves a good profit margin. Past winning bids have been ranging from mid-30s to mid-60s, with many second-highest bids falling in the mid-40s to low-50s range. By bidding 52, I aim to balance the risk of overbidding while maintaining a strong position to win and maximize my profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round and considering the previous rounds' results where winning bids have been significantly higher than the perceived value for winning bidders, I want to be more conservative. Since my value is relatively low compared to the values I've had in previous rounds, a bid of 20 balances being competitive without overinvesting, minimizing potential losses if I don't win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 36 in this round, and based on the previous rounds' data where bids tend to be competitive but often not aligning with the exact value due to variability, I aim to place a bid that is somewhat conservative yet competitive. Given the past bids ranged from mid-20s to mid-60s, a bid of 30 balances the strategy of maintaining competitiveness without risking significant losses if I win, considering the possibility of lower second-highest bids.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 84, I want to bid competitively while avoiding overbidding, which history suggests leads to negative profits. Previous rounds show a pattern of competitive bids around 50-60 when values are high. Thus, a bid of 60 is strategic, allowing me to maximize chances of winning while aiming for a positive profit margin based on likely second-highest bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 47 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it's clear that competitive bids often fall slightly below or above the perceived values. To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overbidding and potential losses, I choose to place a bid of 40. This is strategically conservative yet competitive enough to potentially secure the prize with a positive profit margin, considering second-highest bids often cluster around similar ranges.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 and analyzing the previous rounds where higher bids often resulted in no profit or negative outcomes, I'll adopt a conservative strategy. By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10.

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 23 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds where higher bids often resulted in no profit or negative outcomes, I'll adopt a conservative strategy. By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize and the historical bidding trends where winning bids range between the mid-30s and mid-40s, I decide to bid 50. This is higher than previous winning bids to increase the chances of winning while still allowing a good profit margin if the second-highest bid is somewhat lower.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 52, 50, 50, 50, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for the prize, I aim to balance winning the auction with maximizing profit. Based on the history where bids above 50 have been competitive and given the higher range of bids in previous rounds, I will increase my bid to 50 to improve my chances of winning while leaving room for a decent profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 12, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 24, 20, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 24 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 26, and considering the historical data where winning bids often range higher but sometimes lower bets can still be competitive, I choose to bid conservatively. With a bid of 24, I aim to keep a margin based on the lower end of competitive bids in previous rounds. This approach minimizes potential losses while still giving me a chance to win if others also bid conservatively.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 37 for the prize this round, I aim to balance winning the auction with maximizing profit. In previous rounds, lower bids have been competitive, particularly in the range of 20-50. I will bid 29 to be conservative, yet still competitive, and to avoid overbidding, increasing my chances of a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 64, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that my value for the prize is 78, and given historical trends where winning bids can range from mid-30s to mid-60s, I'll choose to bid 64. This is higher than my previous bids, which have often been too conservative. By bidding 64, I aim to increase my chance to win while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin based on the assumption that the second-highest bid will likely be lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids tend to be higher, especially in competitive rounds. My aim is to balance winning the prize with making a profit. A bid of 52 is likely to be competitive, given that previous winning bids have ranged between the mid-30s and mid-60s. This bid also leaves some margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 23 for the prize and observing historical bidding trends, I see that successful bids often surpass my value, often by a margin that would result in a loss if I bid close to my total value. Therefore, aiming to bid conservatively to avoid a negative profit and based on the fact that bids around the low to mid-20s resulted in a loss in round 5, I choose to bid 18.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the historical bidding trends and my perceived value of 20, I'm aiming to balance the chances of winning with the maximization of my profit. Based on previous rounds, bids close to my perceived value often lead to a loss. A conservative bid of 18 allows me to be competitive while minimizing potential losses if my value turns out to be higher than the common value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 20 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders. I want to bid enough below my value to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering that bids for winning ranged between 40-65.

In previous rounds, successful bids have been around 50-60 when values were higher.

This bid aims to be competitive while slightly underbidding my perceived value, which should maximize my profit if I win while minimizing potential overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 90 for the prize and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids and second-highest bids are usually determined by a competitive environment with bids often in the mid-30s to high-50s range, occasionally reaching low-60s. To maximize my profit, I need to balance my chances of winning against the cost if I do win. By bidding 70, I strategically position myself to outbid most other competitors while still leaving a significant margin for profit given the rare but possible high second bids approaching this threshold.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, the winning bid has generally ranged from the mid-30s to the high-50s depending on competition. Bidding 37 should be competitive enough to have a fair chance of winning without overbidding, as previous second-highest bids have often been slightly lower. This strategy aims to balance the potential for winning with minimizing the risk of paying too high a price.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it is clear that bids have generally ranged from the mid-30s to high-50s depending on competition, with few exceptionally lower bids. Since my value is quite low this round, winning is unlikely, and overbidding would cause a loss. Therefore, bidding 6 allows me to stay in the game and also avoid unnecessary risks, optimizing my profit strategy considering the higher likely bids from other players.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 13 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, it is evident that bidding has been competitive, typically with higher bids in the intermediate rounds, and lower bids when the values are less. Since any bid lower than my value keeps me in the positive profit margin if I win, and accounting for the chance to win with minimal bidders close to my value, I think bidding 9 might offer a balance between overbidding and aiming to secure the prize with positive profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged quite widely but tend to be lower when values are smaller. My bid of 18 balances staying competitive without overbidding significantly, optimizing the potential to win with minimal loss if the second-highest bid is close.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 27 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Looking at the history where the highest bids were in the mid- to high-30s, bidding 38 seems reasonable to give me a competitive edge while leaving room for a potential profit by paying the second-highest bid.'

The history shows that bids are often in the 40s to 50s for higher values. Since my value is significantly lower this round, bidding 12 seems reasonable. This bid increases my chances of a profit if the second-highest bid is low and helps me avoid significant losses.'

This is below my value, reducing the risk of overpaying if I win, and my low value suggests high competition isn\u2019t expected. This also aims to increase the chances of earning a profit if the second-highest bid is notably lower.'

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 this round and analyzing the history where perceived values and bids vary, bidding 6 strategically places me below my value to avoid overbidding. Considering the competition with potential higher private adjustments, a bid lower than my value helps mitigate the risk of substantial losses. Lower values in previous rounds also resulted in relatively lower bids. Therefore, a bid of 6 maximizes my chances for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is low.'

This approach minimizes the risk of overpayment while still being competitive.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 47 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it's clear that competitive bids often fall slightly below or above the perceived values. To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overbidding and potential losses, I choose to place a bid of 40. This is strategically conservative yet competitive enough to potentially secure the prize with a positive profit margin, considering second-highest bids often cluster around similar ranges.'

By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high.'

By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high. This approach also considers that given the history, my probability of winning with a higher profit is lower if I bid too close to my perceived value.'

My aim is to balance winning the prize with making a profit. A bid of 52 is likely to be competitive, given that previous winning bids have ranged between the mid-30s and mid-60s.

In the past rounds with lower perceived values, such as rounds 5, 9, and 10, conservative bids close to or below 20 ended in losses or minimal gains.

A bid of 33 ensures that if I win, it's with an acceptable margin based on others possibly bidding close but slightly lower.'

In previous rounds, the highest bids were in the 35-40 range, and I believe a bid of 64 will likely outbid others without going over my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 60, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit while staying competitive. In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders. I want to bid enough below my value to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering that bids for winning ranged between 40-65. Therefore, a bid of 58 should allow me a good chance to win without likely overpaying.'

In previous rounds, successful bids have been around 50-60 when values were higher. With a value of 21, I estimate that a bid of 18 will give me a competitive edge while avoiding overpayment, considering the perceived values of others might also be relatively lower in this range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 41 and the history indicating a trend where highest bids have often been close to or below their perceived value, a bid of 38 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while slightly underbidding my perceived value, which should maximize my profit if I win while minimizing potential overpayment.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 52, I aim to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overbid and stay close to my perceived value. Historical data suggests other high bids range close to their perceived values. Thus, bidding exactly 52 should give me a competitive edge while taking into consideration that values are redrawn independently each round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 4, it is highly unlikely that I will gain profit from winning the prize. The historical bids in prior rounds indicate much higher values, making it unwise to bid anything in this round. Therefore, I will bid 0 to avoid potential loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 13 and the trends in historical bids, it is not likely that I will gain significant profit from winning this prize. Previous rounds suggest the second-highest bids often cluster close to competitive bids. A lower bid of 10 attempts to stay competitive without risking an overpayment if the perceived values of other bidders are similarly low.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10.

Since my value is quite low this round, winning is unlikely, and overbidding would cause a loss. Therefore, bidding 6 allows me to stay in the game and also avoid unnecessary risks, optimizing my profit strategy considering the higher likely bids from other players.'

Since any bid lower than my value keeps me in the positive profit margin if I win, and accounting for the chance to win with minimal bidders close to my value, I think bidding 9 might offer a balance between overbidding and aiming to secure the prize with positive profit.'

Looking at the history where the highest bids were in the mid- to high-30s, bidding 38 seems reasonable to give me a competitive edge while leaving room for a potential profit by paying the second-highest bid.'

The history shows that bids are often in the 40s to 50s for higher values. Since my value is significantly lower this round, bidding 12 seems reasonable.

This is below my value, reducing the risk of overpaying if I win, and my low value suggests high competition isn\u2019t expected. This also aims to increase the chances of earning a profit if the second-highest bid is notably lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 this round and analyzing the history where perceived values and bids vary, bidding 6 strategically places me below my value to avoid overbidding. Considering the competition with potential higher private adjustments, a bid lower than my value helps mitigate the risk of substantial losses. Lower values in previous rounds also resulted in relatively lower bids. Therefore, a bid of 6 maximizes my chances for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is low.'

This approach minimizes the risk of overpayment while still being competitive. Historically, bids have varied significantly, and aiming for a bid slightly lower than my value has helped ensure that I minimize potential losses if the second-highest bid is lower. Therefore, bidding 18 should balance competitiveness and profitability.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 34, to maximize my profit, I aim to win the prize at a cost lower than my perceived value. A bid of 33 ensures that if I win, it's with an acceptable margin based on others possibly bidding close but slightly lower.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 65, I want to bid just below my perceived value to potentially secure the prize while maximizing my profit margin. In previous rounds, the highest bids were in the 35-40 range, and I believe a bid of 64 will likely outbid others without going over my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 60, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit while staying competitive. In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders. I want to bid enough below my value to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering that bids for winning ranged between 40-65. Therefore, a bid of 58 should allow me a good chance to win without likely overpaying.'

Historical bids show a tendency for the highest bids to be in the range of 50-60. A bid of 55 strikes a balance by being competitive enough to potentially win without overpaying.'

In previous rounds, successful bids have been around 50-60 when values were higher. With a value of 21, I estimate that a bid of 18 will give me a competitive edge while avoiding overpayment, considering the perceived values of others might also be relatively lower in this range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 41 and the history indicating a trend where highest bids have often been close to or below their perceived value, a bid of 38 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while slightly underbidding my perceived value, which should maximize my profit if I win while minimizing potential overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 87 and historical data showing bids often range below the perceived value to ensure a win without overpaying, an optimistic yet cautious bid of 80 should balance competitiveness and potential profit.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 52, I aim to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overbid and stay close to my perceived value. Historical data suggests other high bids range close to their perceived values. Thus, bidding exactly 52 should give me a competitive edge while taking into consideration that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 4, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 4, it is highly unlikely that I will gain profit from winning the prize. The historical bids in prior rounds indicate much higher values, making it unwise to bid anything in this round. Therefore, I will bid 0 to avoid potential loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 13 and the trends in historical bids, it is not likely that I will gain significant profit from winning this prize. Previous rounds suggest the second-highest bids often cluster close to competitive bids. A lower bid of 10 attempts to stay competitive without risking an overpayment if the perceived values of other bidders are similarly low.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10.

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I want to bid lower to maximize my profit while maintaining a competitive edge. Historical bids show that lower values result in a weaker competition, so a bid of 15 should position me well without significant risk of overpayment.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -14.\\nYour total profit is -46. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 30, 20, 20, 10.

Since any bid lower than my value keeps me in the positive profit margin if I win, and accounting for the chance to win with minimal bidders close to my value, I think bidding 9 might offer a balance between overbidding and aiming to secure the prize with positive profit.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged quite widely but tend to be lower when values are smaller. My bid of 18 balances staying competitive without overbidding significantly, optimizing the potential to win with minimal loss if the second-highest bid is close.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 27 and analyzing the historical bidding patterns from previous rounds, a competitive bid that balances the chances of winning without significantly overbidding is important. Historically, other bidders have been quite aggressive, often with bids in the mid to high ranges even when perceived values were lower. To maximize profit while minimizing risk, a bid of 20 should make me competitive enough to still be in contention without heavily incurring losses if I do win.'

In rounds where values were high, such as round 7 with a perceived value of 90, bidding around the 70s was both competitive and strategic. This bid balances the need to outbid others and maximize profit by avoiding excessive overpayment if the second-highest bid is in the lower 60s or higher.

The history shows that bids are often in the 40s to 50s for higher values. Since my value is significantly lower this round, bidding 12 seems reasonable.

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 this round and analyzing the history where perceived values and bids vary, bidding 6 strategically places me below my value to avoid overbidding. Considering the competition with potential higher private adjustments, a bid lower than my value helps mitigate the risk of substantial losses. Lower values in previous rounds also resulted in relatively lower bids. Therefore, a bid of 6 maximizes my chances for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is low.'

This approach minimizes the risk of overpayment while still being competitive. Historically, bids have varied significantly, and aiming for a bid slightly lower than my value has helped ensure that I minimize potential losses if the second-highest bid is lower. Therefore, bidding 18 should balance competitiveness and profitability.'

In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 47 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, it's clear that competitive bids often fall slightly below or above the perceived values. To maximize my chances of winning while avoiding overbidding and potential losses, I choose to place a bid of 40. This is strategically conservative yet competitive enough to potentially secure the prize with a positive profit margin, considering second-highest bids often cluster around similar ranges.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 and analyzing the previous rounds where higher bids often resulted in no profit or negative outcomes, I'll adopt a conservative strategy. By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 23 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds where higher bids often resulted in no profit or negative outcomes, I'll adopt a conservative strategy. By bidding 15, I remain competitive yet conservative enough to minimize potential losses, recognizing that others may also bid lower when their values are not significantly high. This approach also considers that given the history, my probability of winning with a higher profit is lower if I bid too close to my perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 28 and analyzing the results from the previous rounds, competitive yet conservative bids have often ranged from mid-20s to mid-30s. Since higher bids frequently resulted in no profit or negative outcomes, a bid of 22 aims to be competitive without risking significant losses. This strategy considers the likelihood of winning with a positive profit margin, balancing between being competitive and avoiding overbidding.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 30, 20, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 38 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns where bids tended to vary based on perceived values and typically resulted in losses when bidding too high, I will take a moderately conservative approach. Previous competitive bids have often ranged from mid-20s to mid-30s for similar values, aiming for a balance between being competitive and avoiding overbidding. By bidding 30, I aim to maximize my chances of winning without risking significant losses, adjusting for the common value and other bidders' potential strategies.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 75, 68, 68, 65, 60.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for this round and considering the previous rounds' history, competitive bids in similar ranges often fall around 50-60, especially when values are higher.

In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 29, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 37, 30, 29, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 37 for the prize this round, I aim to balance winning the auction with maximizing profit. In previous rounds, lower bids have been competitive, particularly in the range of 20-50. I will bid 29 to be conservative, yet still competitive, and to avoid overbidding, increasing my chances of a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 64, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 70, 70, 64, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that my value for the prize is 78, and given historical trends where winning bids can range from mid-30s to mid-60s, I'll choose to bid 64. This is higher than my previous bids, which have often been too conservative. By bidding 64, I aim to increase my chance to win while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin based on the assumption that the second-highest bid will likely be lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for the prize and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids tend to be higher, especially in competitive rounds. My aim is to balance winning the prize with making a profit. A bid of 52 is likely to be competitive, given that previous winning bids have ranged between the mid-30s and mid-60s. This bid also leaves some margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 23 for the prize and observing historical bidding trends, I see that successful bids often surpass my value, often by a margin that would result in a loss if I bid close to my total value. Therefore, aiming to bid conservatively to avoid a negative profit and based on the fact that bids around the low to mid-20s resulted in a loss in round 5, I choose to bid 18.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the historical bidding trends and my perceived value of 20, I'm aiming to balance the chances of winning with the maximization of my profit. Based on previous rounds, bids close to my perceived value often lead to a loss. A conservative bid of 18 allows me to be competitive while minimizing potential losses if my value turns out to be higher than the common value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 20 and analyzing the historical results, it's clear that higher bids typically result in negative profits. In the past rounds with lower perceived values, such as rounds 5, 9, and 10, conservative bids close to or below 20 ended in losses or minimal gains. By bidding 6, I aim to stay very conservative, minimizing potential loss especially when the true common value is unknown, and given that lower bids have sometimes won or minimized losses in similar situations.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 30, 20, 20, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 21, and based on the historical trend of bids and resulting profits, I'm opting for a conservative bid approach. Higher bids in past rounds have generally resulted in negative profits, especially when the common value is low. By bidding 10, I aim to minimize potential losses while still being in the running for the prize if others also bid conservatively.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 75, 68, 68, 65, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 78 and paid 75. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 82 for this round, I'll aim to place a higher bid that is sufficiently competitive while leaving room for profit. In previous rounds, higher perceived values didn't necessarily guarantee a win when bids were too conservative. By bidding 68, I position myself among the likely highest bidders without nearing the top end, thereby increasing my chances to win and making a profit if the second-highest bid remains lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 16 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 36. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 34, to maximize my profit, I aim to win the prize at a cost lower than my perceived value. A bid of 33 ensures that if I win, it's with an acceptable margin based on others possibly bidding close but slightly lower.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 42, 41, 41, 40, 38, 38. The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 41. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 43, I want to bid slightly below my perceived value but higher than most historical bids to increase my chances of winning. In the previous round, the highest bids were 36 and 35, so a bid of 41 has a good probability of winning while ensuring my profit margin remains positive.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 64, the (true) common value of the prize was 54, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 60, 50, 50, 46, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 65, I want to bid just below my perceived value to potentially secure the prize while maximizing my profit margin. In previous rounds, the highest bids were in the 35-40 range, and I believe a bid of 64 will likely outbid others without going over my perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 50, 50, 48, 47, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 50. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 60, I need to bid strategically to maximize my profit while staying competitive. In the previous rounds, successful bids hovered around the value a little below the perceived value of bidders. I want to bid enough below my value to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering that bids for winning ranged between 40-65. Therefore, a bid of 58 should allow me a good chance to win without likely overpaying.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 46, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -6.\\nYour total profit is -17. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 52, 50, 50, 50, 48.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 57, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value to increase chances of winning while maximizing profit. Historical bids show a tendency for the highest bids to be in the range of 50-60. A bid of 55 strikes a balance by being competitive enough to potentially win without overpaying.'

In previous rounds, successful bids have been around 50-60 when values were higher. With a value of 21, I estimate that a bid of 18 will give me a competitive edge while avoiding overpayment, considering the perceived values of others might also be relatively lower in this range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 41 and the history indicating a trend where highest bids have often been close to or below their perceived value, a bid of 38 is strategic. This bid aims to be competitive while slightly underbidding my perceived value, which should maximize my profit if I win while minimizing potential overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 87 and historical data showing bids often range below the perceived value to ensure a win without overpaying, an optimistic yet cautious bid of 80 should balance competitiveness and potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 45, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 48, 45, 40, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 52, I aim to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I don't overbid and stay close to my perceived value. Historical data suggests other high bids range close to their perceived values. Thus, bidding exactly 52 should give me a competitive edge while taking into consideration that values are redrawn independently each round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 4, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 3, 18, 15, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 4, it is highly unlikely that I will gain profit from winning the prize. The historical bids in prior rounds indicate much higher values, making it unwise to bid anything in this round. Therefore, I will bid 0 to avoid potential loss.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 6, 5, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 13 and the trends in historical bids, it is not likely that I will gain significant profit from winning this prize. Previous rounds suggest the second-highest bids often cluster close to competitive bids. A lower bid of 10 attempts to stay competitive without risking an overpayment if the perceived values of other bidders are similarly low.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 22, 18, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18, I want to bid lower to maximize my profit while maintaining a competitive edge. Historical bids show that lower values result in a weaker competition, so a bid of 15 should position me well without significant risk of overpayment.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 21, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -14.\\nYour total profit is -46. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 35, 30, 20, 20, 10.

The winner's profit was -14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value towards the prize is 41 and the bidding history shows a trend of bids often being close to but below perceived values, I believe a bid of 39 should be competitive. This strategy aims to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a better profit margin by staying below my total value.'

To maximize my chances of winning without overpaying, I will bid slightly below my value. A bid of 78 balances competitiveness and aims to ensure a profit margin if I win, considering past bidding behaviors in rounds with high perceived values.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 10 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 48, a reasonable strategy is to bid slightly below my value, specifically at 39. This strategy assumes that other bidders might also bid slightly below their values, aiming to win the prize without overpaying. By bidding 39, I try to ensure a profit margin while considering that the second-highest bid may be close to this amount based on typical bidding behavior.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the historical data from round 0, where bids varied between 20 and 39, bidding at 65 should position me as a strong contender to win without excessively overbidding. This bid balances the risk of overpaying with the potential for maximizing profit, considering my high value for this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11 and considering the historical bids from previous rounds, which ranged from 20 to 70, I should bid conservatively to avoid a negative profit. Therefore, bidding 6 should minimize potential losses and allow for an optimal bid given the low perceived value in this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round and the historical data from the previous rounds where bids varied significantly, I want to choose a bid that balances competitiveness with the potential for profit. The highest bids previously ranged from 6 to 70, with the second-highest bids forming a critical factor in determining profit. By bidding 28, I aim to stay competitive enough to win while ensuring I do not overbid compared to my perceived value. This bid accounts for the previously observed bidding patterns and aims to maximize my expected profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 22 and the historical bid patterns, it's important to bid conservatively to maximize profit and minimize risk. In previous rounds, bidding slightly lower than my value has usually been a good balance. The highest bids in the past rounds ranged from 6 to 70, with second-highest bids determining the payment made. By bidding 18, I aim to stay competitive without overestimating the second-highest bid, hoping to secure a win at an optimal cost.'

Since my value is 74, bidding around 62 should provide a strong chance of winning while limiting the bid below my maximum valuation to leave room for profit.

Given my high value of 77 for this round's prize, I want to bid competitively to maximize the chance of winning while still leaving a reasonable profit margin. Bidding 70 should outbid others while also ensuring good profit assuming the second-highest bid remains in the expected range based on historical data.'

The history shows previous bids range from 20 to 70, with higher perceived values eliciting higher bids. Adjusting for my lower perceived value this round, a bid of 18 is cautious yet slightly aggressive compared to past lower bids, maximizing potential profit while trying to minimize loss if outbid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that in previous rounds the winning bids typically ranged from low 40s to high 60s, and given my perceived value of 56, I will bid 47 to increase my chances of winning the prize while leaving a buffer for a net profit. This bid strikes a balance between competitiveness and potential profitability.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 22 for this round's prize and analyzing the historical bid ranges, I want to set a bid that's competitive yet cautious, leaving room for profit if I win. High bids have often gone beyond 25, so a bid of 17 should give me a chance to win against lower bids without risking excessive loss.'

Analyzing the history, winning bids tend to fall within the 40-70 range, and second-highest bids are often in the 30-60 range.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the historical data from round 0, where bids varied between 20 and 39, bidding at 65 should position me as a strong contender to win without excessively overbidding. This bid balances the risk of overpaying with the potential for maximizing profit, considering my high value for this round.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 11 and considering the historical bids from previous rounds, which ranged from 20 to 70, I should bid conservatively to avoid a negative profit. Therefore, bidding 6 should minimize potential losses and allow for an optimal bid given the low perceived value in this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round and the historical data from the previous rounds where bids varied significantly, I want to choose a bid that balances competitiveness with the potential for profit. The highest bids previously ranged from 6 to 70, with the second-highest bids forming a critical factor in determining profit. By bidding 28, I aim to stay competitive enough to win while ensuring I do not overbid compared to my perceived value. This bid accounts for the previously observed bidding patterns and aims to maximize my expected profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 22 and the historical bid patterns, it's important to bid conservatively to maximize profit and minimize risk. In previous rounds, bidding slightly lower than my value has usually been a good balance. The highest bids in the past rounds ranged from 6 to 70, with second-highest bids determining the payment made. By bidding 18, I aim to stay competitive without overestimating the second-highest bid, hoping to secure a win at an optimal cost.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my previous rounds of bidding and their outcomes, bidding slightly below my value tends to position me competitively without overpaying. Since my value is 74, bidding around 62 should provide a strong chance of winning while limiting the bid below my maximum valuation to leave room for profit. This bid considers the trend of winning bids and aims to balance risk and reward effectively.'

However, to remain competitive and have a chance at a profit, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value to try and secure a profit margin if I win.

For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid.

This bid of 20 allows room to earn a profit should I win while minimizing potential losses if someone bids higher.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history from the first round, the bids ranged from 20 to 39. Given my high value of 77 for this round's prize, I want to bid competitively to maximize the chance of winning while still leaving a reasonable profit margin. Bidding 70 should outbid others while also ensuring good profit assuming the second-highest bid remains in the expected range based on historical data.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 23 for this round's prize, I want to set a bid that's competitive but leaves room for profit. The history shows previous bids range from 20 to 70, with higher perceived values eliciting higher bids. Adjusting for my lower perceived value this round, a bid of 18 is cautious yet slightly aggressive compared to past lower bids, maximizing potential profit while trying to minimize loss if outbid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering that in previous rounds the winning bids typically ranged from low 40s to high 60s, and given my perceived value of 56, I will bid 47 to increase my chances of winning the prize while leaving a buffer for a net profit. This bid strikes a balance between competitiveness and potential profitability.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 22 for this round's prize and analyzing the historical bid ranges, I want to set a bid that's competitive yet cautious, leaving room for profit if I win. High bids have often gone beyond 25, so a bid of 17 should give me a chance to win against lower bids without risking excessive loss.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 64 for this round, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. Analyzing the history, winning bids tend to fall within the 40-70 range, and second-highest bids are often in the 30-60 range. By bidding 58, I increase my chances of winning without risking too much profit if the second-highest bid is close to my own.'

From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost.

My perceived value is 16, which is quite low. Given that the true common value will likely be different, it's prudent to bid conservatively. Bidding 14 allows me to remain competitive in the auction while minimizing potential losses, considering the second-highest bid may still be close to my perceived value or higher.'

My previous bids were often lower relative to my perceived values, ranging from 5 to 60, without achieving positive profit. Noting that successful bids tend to cluster around mid-range values and considering that my value is toward the higher end this time, bidding 40 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding overexpenditure, aiming to maximize profit potential while considering other bidders' tendencies.'

Previous rounds showed that lower bids can sometimes win and the second-highest bid sets the cost. Bidding 28 positions me to potentially win without exceeding my perceived value significantly, hence maximizing profit potential while being cautious.'

From previous rounds, I've seen competitive bids but based on my low perceived value, I aim to minimize risk.

In the initial round, competitive bids ranged around the 30s, and in subsequent rounds, there were higher bids when perceived values were high. However, I need to be cautious not to overestimate the common value. Thus, a bid of 38 is strategic; it is significant enough to compete without risking a massive loss should the second-highest bid be substantially lower.'

For this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying, especially since the common value and other bidders' private adjustments can be quite different. By bidding 10, I take a strategic approach to potentially secure the prize without risking a large overpayment, as a bid significantly lower than my value should help manage the risk if others' bids aren't extremely high.'

Since the auction's highest bidder pays the second-highest bid and values are independently redrawn, bidding slightly lower than my perceived value but still competitively may increase my chances of winning while keeping the payment lower.

Given my perceived value of 89, I would like to bid competitively but still leave a margin below my value. In the prior round, the highest bids were around 39. Assuming a similar behavior from other bidders, bidding 60 should keep me in a competitive position while minimizing the payment if I win.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 45, I need to bid in a way that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing the payment if I win. The previous rounds have shown high variation in bids, with some winning bids being significantly higher than others. A bid of 25 strikes a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while keeping my costs lower if I do win. This is based on analyzing previous rounds where bids like 30 and 60 were placed based on values around 41 and 89, respectively, but resulted in no profit.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that bids tend to vary widely, but lower value rounds (like round 2 with perceived value 23) had successful bids in similar ranges. By bidding 5, I acknowledge the low prize value while attempting to stay competitive without unnecessary risk.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 65 for the prize this round and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it's clear that bids close to values can lead to overpaying and negative profits. My previous bids were often lower relative to my perceived values, ranging from 5 to 60, without achieving positive profit. Noting that successful bids tend to cluster around mid-range values and considering that my value is toward the higher end this time, bidding 40 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding overexpenditure, aiming to maximize profit potential while considering other bidders' tendencies.'

Previous rounds showed that lower bids can sometimes win and the second-highest bid sets the cost. Bidding 28 positions me to potentially win without exceeding my perceived value significantly, hence maximizing profit potential while being cautious.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 70 this round, I want to place a bid that balances competitiveness with the likelihood of winning without overpaying. From reviewing previous rounds, high bids around perceived values typically lead to overbidding and negative profits. Historically, winning bids have sometimes clustered around 30 to 60, and increasing my bid slightly compared to previous lower bids may help maximize the chance of winning while avoiding paying too much. Therefore, bidding 53 seems appropriate for optimizing potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that each bidder's perceived value varies and everyone aims to maximize their profit, I should consider bidding moderately below my own perceived value to leave room for profit. Based on typical competitive bidding dynamics, a bid of 27 provides a reasonable balance between winning the prize and ensuring a positive net gain if another bid is close.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 74 for this round, the goal is to balance bidding competitively while ensuring a profit margin. From previous rounds, we know bids have varied, with the highest at 39 and the second highest at 32. Bidding 60 would likely secure the prize while still leaving a margin of profit based on the expectation that the second highest bid tends to be lower, while acknowledging that specific values reset each round.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 20, 18, 15, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round, I should aim to bid lower to ensure any profit margin possible if I win. From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost. This bid protects against overbidding and focuses on potential profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 45, 38, 35, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 58 for this round, I aim to bid high enough to be competitive without overbidding. From previous rounds, we observe that the winning bid is usually above 39 but not excessively high. A bid of 45 places me in a strong position to win the prize while potentially keeping the second-highest bid (and my payment) lower, thereby maximizing my profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 18, 17, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous rounds, we observe that the second-highest bids have varied around the 20s-40s. My perceived value is 16, which is quite low. Given that the true common value will likely be different, it's prudent to bid conservatively. Bidding 14 allows me to remain competitive in the auction while minimizing potential losses, considering the second-highest bid may still be close to my perceived value or higher.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 58, 55, 52, 50, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 for this round, I aim to place a competitive bid that maximizes the chance of winning while ensuring profit. From previous rounds, it's evident that bids and second-highest bids can vary greatly but typically those who win have bids in the upper 40s to 70 range. The key is ensuring the bid is below my value of 60 while likely being high enough to outbid others. A bid of 52 strikes a balance, aiming to maximize my profit based on the typical second-highest bids observed in rounds 1-4.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 30, 29, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 for this round, I aim to place a bid that is competitive yet leaves room for profit. From the history, bids have varied with the second-highest bids typically ranging from mid-20s to upper 50s. I will bid 25, which is lower than my perceived value of 33, in hopes it will be high enough to potentially secure the prize while ensuring a profit if the second-highest bid is close to the observed mid-range.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 63 for this round, I aim to place a competitive bid while ensuring I have a profit margin. From previous rounds, we observe bids tend to range from the mid-20s to high 60s, and winning bids often range from mid-30s to low 70s. By bidding 50, I position myself high enough to be competitive while leaving enough cushion for profit, assuming the second-highest bid will likely be lower but somewhere within the typical mid to high range.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 15.

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 25, I aim to bid conservatively to ensure a profit margin if I win, while being aware that bids from previous rounds suggest a somewhat competitive landscape. The winning bids have often been around the upper half of the range, typically in the 30s to 60s, with second-highest bids often being a bit lower. Therefore, a bid of 19 is low enough to possibly secure a win without overcommitting and ensures a chance for a positive return if the second-highest bid is close to the lower end of the observed typical range.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 49 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 and analyzing the historical bid patterns, I aim to bid 36. This bid is based on the strategy observed where slightly underbidding relative to my perceived value has generally been effective. It ensures competitiveness while protecting against overpayment, considering the past rounds' second-highest bids and the current auction dynamics.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 63 and analyzing the historical bid patterns from previous rounds, I notice that bidding slightly below my perceived value has often been effective. Considering second-highest bids are typically lower yet close, bidding 51 should position me competitively without excessively overshooting, potentially ensuring a profit if I win.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 15.

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, along with the historical data indicating second-highest bids ranging widely, bidding about 22 positions me competitively while avoiding overpayment. Previous rounds have shown that bidding conservatively, slightly below perceived value, often maximizes profit while remaining competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 37 for this round, I will bid 27. My strategy is based on the history of previous rounds, where highest bids tend to cluster around 30-55 when the perceived values are higher. Bidding 27 positions me competitively without overpaying, considering previous second-highest bids often fall close to this range.

This indicates a high level of competition among bidders. Given my value this round is 19, a lower perceived value compared to prior rounds, it\u2019s less ideal to bid too high. However, to remain competitive and have a chance at a profit, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value to try and secure a profit margin if I win. A bid of 14 takes into account the competitive nature witnessed so far, while aiming for potential profit without overcommitting on a low-value prize.'

From previous rounds, bids have been competitive, often exceeding perceived values significantly. Setting my bid at 8 positions me to potentially win if other bidders undervalue the prize, while minimizing my risk if the higher bids from others continue.

It keeps me competitive but avoids overcommitting. Previous rounds indicate that bids closer to the perceived value tend to win, but the second-highest bids also tend to be close.

From the previous rounds, the distribution of bids has shown a trend where high bids often win but come with the risk of a slim profit margin or a loss. By selecting 55, I position myself with a strong bid likely to surpass many competitors but still retain a buffer below my perceived value of 72 to potentially secure a profit margin.

The history shows previous bids range from 20 to 70, with higher perceived values eliciting higher bids. Adjusting for my lower perceived value this round, a bid of 18 is cautious yet slightly aggressive compared to past lower bids, maximizing potential profit while trying to minimize loss if outbid.'

Analyzing the history, winning bids tend to fall within the 40-70 range, and second-highest bids are often in the 30-60 range.

For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 47, I want to ensure I bid strategically to maximize profit. Assuming the private values of others might be similar, I choose a bid that is reasonably lower than my value but substantial enough to outbid moderate bids from others.'

In the previous round, the highest bid was 39, so a bid of 42 should be competitive while managing the risk of overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize this round is 14, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying if the common value and other bidders' adjustments are not high. From previous rounds, I've seen competitive bids but based on my low perceived value, I aim to minimize risk. An optimal strategy here would be to bid slightly below the perceived value to ensure a chance of profit if others undervalue the prize.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round and the observations from previous rounds, I want to place a bid that balances competitiveness with the risk of overpaying. In the initial round, competitive bids ranged around the 30s, and in subsequent rounds, there were higher bids when perceived values were high. However, I need to be cautious not to overestimate the common value. Thus, a bid of 38 is strategic; it is significant enough to compete without risking a massive loss should the second-highest bid be substantially lower.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19, and considering the bids from previous rounds, the highest winning bids have varied quite widely from 6 to 70. For this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying, especially since the common value and other bidders' private adjustments can be quite different. By bidding 10, I take a strategic approach to potentially secure the prize without risking a large overpayment, as a bid significantly lower than my value should help manage the risk if others' bids aren't extremely high.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 58, 55, 52, 50, 40.

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 68, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring I don't overpay significantly above the second-highest bid. Based on historical data, competitive winning bids have ranged from 6 to 70. I will bid 55 as it is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while leaving some room for profit if the second-highest bid is not too close to my bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 30, 29, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 37, I want to strategically bid lower than my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit without overpaying. Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely with occasional high outliers. Hence, a bid of 30 positions me competitively while being below my value, balancing the competition and potential payoff.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 66, I want to place a competitive bid while minimizing the risk of overpaying significantly above the second-highest bid. Historically, competitive bids have varied widely with the highest winning bids ranging from 6 to 70. In several instances, the second-highest bids have been substantially lower than the highest bids. Strategically, a bid of 45 positions me well enough to compete effectively without risking a large loss if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 39, I want to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with profitability. In previous rounds, I've seen that winning bids have ranged widely and the key seems to be bidding just below my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit and avoid overpaying. For instance, in round 6, I bid 30 and almost won, indicating it's a competitive but cautious bid in a mid-value range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, and taking into account the historical bidding patterns where high bids frequently lead to minimal or negative profits, I aim to place a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 40 is high enough to outcompete several opponents based on prior rounds but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower.

However, to remain competitive and have a chance at a profit, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value to try and secure a profit margin if I win. A bid of 14 takes into account the competitive nature witnessed so far, while aiming for potential profit without overcommitting on a low-value prize.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 45, 38, 35, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, bids and values have been quite variable, but there's a consistent pattern of competitive bids generally being in the mid to high range. With a value of 49, it's crucial to balance the possibility of winning with the need to avoid overpaying relative to the second-highest bid. Bidding 35 should position me competitively without severely impacting my profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 18, 17, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 12 for this round's prize, my objective is to bid conservatively to avoid overcommitting. From previous rounds, bids have been competitive, often exceeding perceived values significantly. Setting my bid at 8 positions me to potentially win if other bidders undervalue the prize, while minimizing my risk if the higher bids from others continue. This strategy aims to balance between maintaining a competitive presence and preserving potential profits.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 58, 55, 52, 50, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my history and the competitive nature of the bids, with perceived values often leading to high or very close second-highest bids, I'll bid 50. This aggressive yet cautious approach should give me a strong chance of winning without overpaying drastically, aiming for profit by staying under the hypothetical second-highest bid derived from patterns thus far.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 30, 29, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 42, and looking at the historical bids, a bid around 29 is a strategic choice. It keeps me competitive but avoids overcommitting. Previous rounds indicate that bids closer to the perceived value tend to win, but the second-highest bids also tend to be close. By bidding 29, I heighten my chances of winning while aiming to minimize potential losses if higher bids surface.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 72 for this round, my aim is to bid competitively yet avoid a high overpayment. From the previous rounds, the distribution of bids has shown a trend where high bids often win but come with the risk of a slim profit margin or a loss. By selecting 55, I position myself with a strong bid likely to surpass many competitors but still retain a buffer below my perceived value of 72 to potentially secure a profit margin. This price effectively balances aggressiveness and caution, aiming to capitalize on the competitive natures observed while limiting potential losses.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'With a value of 32 for this round, it's important to remain competitive while avoiding overspending. From previous rounds, bids have been quite variable, but the range often hovers around mid to high values when the perceived value is moderate to high. By bidding 25, I position myself with a strong chance of winning without overcommitting, given the pattern of previous bids. This strategy aims to capture a profit margin by keeping the bid below the perceived value and anticipating the competitive nature of other bidders.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, I aim to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with the potential for a profit. Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster around strong mid to high ranges when perceived values are in a moderate to high band. To increase my chances of winning without risking a high overpayment, I will bid 38. This bid is aggressive enough to place me competitively based on past bidding patterns while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to aim for a profit margin.'

My previous bids were often lower relative to my perceived values, ranging from 5 to 60, without achieving positive profit.

Analyzing the history, winning bids tend to fall within the 40-70 range, and second-highest bids are often in the 30-60 range. By bidding 58, I increase my chances of winning without risking too much profit if the second-highest bid is close to my own.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 for this round, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. Historically, bids have ranged widely, but winning bids are often in the 40-70 range, with second-highest bids frequently in the 30-60 range. Bidding 50 should give me a solid chance to win while leaving enough room for a profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 29 for this round's prize, I want to set a bid that's cautious yet competitive, reflecting my perceived value while minimizing potential loss. Historical data shows bids can vary widely, but competitive bids for similar perceived values have often ranged in the 20-40 area. Given past instances where my cautious bids were close to winning, a bid of 20 should balance potential profit and loss.'

Historical data show that winning bids often range in the high 40s to low 60s, with the second-highest bids frequently falling a bit lower. Bidding 47 allows me to stay competitive and increases my chance of winning while providing a buffer to achieve a profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

From previous rounds, we know bids have varied, with the highest at 39 and the second highest at 32. Bidding 60 would likely secure the prize while still leaving a margin of profit based on the expectation that the second highest bid tends to be lower, while acknowledging that specific values reset each round.'

From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost. This bid protects against overbidding and focuses on potential profit.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that bids and second-highest bids can vary greatly but typically those who win have bids in the upper 40s to 70 range.

The winning bids have often been around the upper half of the range, typically in the 30s to 60s, with second-highest bids often being a bit lower. Therefore, a bid of 19 is low enough to possibly secure a win without overcommitting and ensures a chance for a positive return if the second-highest bid is close to the lower end of the observed typical range.'

The highest bids have varied greatly but generally range from mid-30s to up to 70s, with second-highest bids close to the winners. A bid of 40 aims to be competitive while allowing for a profit margin assuming the second-highest bid is in the observed typical range.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 66, I want to place a competitive bid while minimizing the risk of overpaying significantly above the second-highest bid. Historically, competitive bids have varied widely with the highest winning bids ranging from 6 to 70. In several instances, the second-highest bids have been substantially lower than the highest bids. Strategically, a bid of 45 positions me well enough to compete effectively without risking a large loss if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 39, I want to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with profitability. In previous rounds, I've seen that winning bids have ranged widely and the key seems to be bidding just below my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit and avoid overpaying. For instance, in round 6, I bid 30 and almost won, indicating it's a competitive but cautious bid in a mid-value range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, and taking into account the historical bidding patterns where high bids frequently lead to minimal or negative profits, I aim to place a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 40 is high enough to outcompete several opponents based on prior rounds but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This balances the risk and reward effectively given the information available.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 38, 35, 28, 28, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is 48, I want to place a bid that strikes a balance between being competitive and limiting the risk of overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds suggests that bids around 30-40 often participate competitively but can result in minimal or negative profits when the bids are too high.

Given my perceived value of 89, I would like to bid competitively but still leave a margin below my value. In the prior round, the highest bids were around 39. Assuming a similar behavior from other bidders, bidding 60 should keep me in a competitive position while minimizing the payment if I win.'

The previous rounds have shown high variation in bids, with some winning bids being significantly higher than others. A bid of 25 strikes a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while keeping my costs lower if I do win.

My previous bids were often lower relative to my perceived values, ranging from 5 to 60, without achieving positive profit. Noting that successful bids tend to cluster around mid-range values and considering that my value is toward the higher end this time, bidding 40 strikes a balance between being competitive and avoiding overexpenditure, aiming to maximize profit potential while considering other bidders' tendencies.'

From reviewing previous rounds, high bids around perceived values typically lead to overbidding and negative profits. Historically, winning bids have sometimes clustered around 30 to 60, and increasing my bid slightly compared to previous lower bids may help maximize the chance of winning while avoiding paying too much. Therefore, bidding 53 seems appropriate for optimizing potential profit.'

To maximize my total profit while keeping the competition in mind, it is prudent to bid conservatively yet remain competitive. Bidding 25 should balance the likelihood of winning without overexpenditure, thereby maintaining a potential for positive profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, winning bids that were too high led to negative profits due to overpaying. For instance, previous winning bids around the perceived value led to profits of around -4 and -5. To optimize my chances, a bid of 45 strikes a balance by being high enough to stand a competitive chance without risking significant overpayment, especially since bids above 60 have often not been profitable.

From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost. This bid protects against overbidding and focuses on potential profit.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that bids and second-highest bids can vary greatly but typically those who win have bids in the upper 40s to 70 range.

The winning bids have often been around the upper half of the range, typically in the 30s to 60s, with second-highest bids often being a bit lower. Therefore, a bid of 19 is low enough to possibly secure a win without overcommitting and ensures a chance for a positive return if the second-highest bid is close to the lower end of the observed typical range.'

In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, and taking into account the historical bidding patterns where high bids frequently lead to minimal or negative profits, I aim to place a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 40 is high enough to outcompete several opponents based on prior rounds but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This balances the risk and reward effectively given the information available.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 38, 35, 28, 28, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is 48, I want to place a bid that strikes a balance between being competitive and limiting the risk of overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds suggests that bids around 30-40 often participate competitively but can result in minimal or negative profits when the bids are too high. Therefore, a bid of 35 positions me well within a competitive range while minimizing potential overpayment.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 60, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 50, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 71 and taking into consideration the historical bidding patterns, bidding around 50 appears to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overpayment. Observing past rounds, high bids often result in minimal or negative profits due to overbidding. A bid of 50 is substantial enough to outbid lower to mid-range bids but still leaves ample room for potential profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 45 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

My strategy is based on the history of previous rounds, where highest bids tend to cluster around 30-55 when the perceived values are higher. Bidding 27 positions me competitively without overpaying, considering previous second-highest bids often fall close to this range. This approach balances potential win risk and profit margin, given the typical bidding behavior observed.'

This strategy aims to capture a profit margin by keeping the bid below the perceived value and anticipating the competitive nature of other bidders.'

Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster around strong mid to high ranges when perceived values are in a moderate to high band. To increase my chances of winning without risking a high overpayment, I will bid 38. This bid is aggressive enough to place me competitively based on past bidding patterns while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to aim for a profit margin.'

By bidding 27, I aim to be competitive without overcommitting financially. This bid is strategically conservative, intending to maximize potential profit if I win while maintaining a balance between competitiveness and avoiding an overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have generally been competitive, often quite high when the perceived values are also high. With a value of 79, which is the maximum possible, I need to bid aggressively to have a strong chance of winning. However, I want to ensure I still retain a considerable profit margin. By bidding 65, I am positioning myself as a strong contender while leaving enough room to profit even if I have to pay a high second-highest bid.

The previous rounds have shown high variation in bids, with some winning bids being significantly higher than others. A bid of 25 strikes a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while keeping my costs lower if I do win.

My previous bids were often lower relative to my perceived values, ranging from 5 to 60, without achieving positive profit.

From reviewing previous rounds, high bids around perceived values typically lead to overbidding and negative profits. Historically, winning bids have sometimes clustered around 30 to 60, and increasing my bid slightly compared to previous lower bids may help maximize the chance of winning while avoiding paying too much. Therefore, bidding 53 seems appropriate for optimizing potential profit.'

Analyzing previous rounds, winning bids that were too high led to negative profits due to overpaying. For instance, previous winning bids around the perceived value led to profits of around -4 and -5. To optimize my chances, a bid of 45 strikes a balance by being high enough to stand a competitive chance without risking significant overpayment, especially since bids above 60 have often not been profitable. Therefore, this adjusted strategy should help maximize my total profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 58 for this round, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. Historically, bids have ranged widely, but winning bids are often in the 40-70 range, with second-highest bids frequently in the 30-60 range. Bidding 50 should give me a solid chance to win while leaving enough room for a profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 29 for this round's prize, I want to set a bid that's cautious yet competitive, reflecting my perceived value while minimizing potential loss. Historical data shows bids can vary widely, but competitive bids for similar perceived values have often ranged in the 20-40 area. Given past instances where my cautious bids were close to winning, a bid of 20 should balance potential profit and loss.'

Historical data show that winning bids often range in the high 40s to low 60s, with the second-highest bids frequently falling a bit lower. Bidding 47 allows me to stay competitive and increases my chance of winning while providing a buffer to achieve a profit if the second-highest bid is lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 46 for this round's prize and analyzing historical bid patterns, particularly when perceived values were in a similar range, winners often have second-highest bids between 30-40. Therefore, I will bid 38 to stay competitive while leaving room for a profit if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 60, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 50, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61.

Analyzing the historical data, winning bids have generally ranged from the high 50s to low 60s when perceived values are similarly high. By bidding 61, I stay competitive and increase my chances of winning while ensuring a buffer for profit, assuming the second-highest bid is lower, which historically tends to fall within the range of 50-60.'

Based on typical competitive bidding dynamics, a bid of 27 provides a reasonable balance between winning the prize and ensuring a positive net gain if another bid is close.'

From previous rounds, we know bids have varied, with the highest at 39 and the second highest at 32. Bidding 60 would likely secure the prize while still leaving a margin of profit based on the expectation that the second highest bid tends to be lower, while acknowledging that specific values reset each round.'

From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost. This bid protects against overbidding and focuses on potential profit.'

From previous rounds, we observe that the winning bid is usually above 39 but not excessively high.

My perceived value is 16, which is quite low. Given that the true common value will likely be different, it's prudent to bid conservatively. Bidding 14 allows me to remain competitive in the auction while minimizing potential losses, considering the second-highest bid may still be close to my perceived value or higher.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that bids and second-highest bids can vary greatly but typically those who win have bids in the upper 40s to 70 range.

The winning bids have often been around the upper half of the range, typically in the 30s to 60s, with second-highest bids often being a bit lower. Therefore, a bid of 19 is low enough to possibly secure a win without overcommitting and ensures a chance for a positive return if the second-highest bid is close to the lower end of the observed typical range.'

The highest bids have varied greatly but generally range from mid-30s to up to 70s, with second-highest bids close to the winners. A bid of 40 aims to be competitive while allowing for a profit margin assuming the second-highest bid is in the observed typical range.'

By bidding 10, I take a strategic approach to potentially secure the prize without risking a large overpayment, as a bid significantly lower than my value should help manage the risk if others' bids aren't extremely high.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 68, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring I don't overpay significantly above the second-highest bid. Based on historical data, competitive winning bids have ranged from 6 to 70. I will bid 55 as it is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while leaving some room for profit if the second-highest bid is not too close to my bid.'

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 37, I want to strategically bid lower than my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit without overpaying. Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely with occasional high outliers. Hence, a bid of 30 positions me competitively while being below my value, balancing the competition and potential payoff.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45.

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 66, I want to place a competitive bid while minimizing the risk of overpaying significantly above the second-highest bid. Historically, competitive bids have varied widely with the highest winning bids ranging from 6 to 70. In several instances, the second-highest bids have been substantially lower than the highest bids. Strategically, a bid of 45 positions me well enough to compete effectively without risking a large loss if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 39, I want to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with profitability. In previous rounds, I've seen that winning bids have ranged widely and the key seems to be bidding just below my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit and avoid overpaying. For instance, in round 6, I bid 30 and almost won, indicating it's a competitive but cautious bid in a mid-value range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, and taking into account the historical bidding patterns where high bids frequently lead to minimal or negative profits, I aim to place a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 40 is high enough to outcompete several opponents based on prior rounds but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This balances the risk and reward effectively given the information available.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is 48, I want to place a bid that strikes a balance between being competitive and limiting the risk of overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds suggests that bids around 30-40 often participate competitively but can result in minimal or negative profits when the bids are too high. Therefore, a bid of 35 positions me well within a competitive range while minimizing potential overpayment.'

Observing past rounds, high bids often result in minimal or negative profits due to overbidding. A bid of 50 is substantial enough to outbid lower to mid-range bids but still leaves ample room for potential profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower.'

However, to remain competitive and have a chance at a profit, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value to try and secure a profit margin if I win. A bid of 14 takes into account the competitive nature witnessed so far, while aiming for potential profit without overcommitting on a low-value prize.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 38, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 45, 38, 35, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, bids and values have been quite variable, but there's a consistent pattern of competitive bids generally being in the mid to high range. With a value of 49, it's crucial to balance the possibility of winning with the need to avoid overpaying relative to the second-highest bid. Bidding 35 should position me competitively without severely impacting my profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 18, 17, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 12 for this round's prize, my objective is to bid conservatively to avoid overcommitting. From previous rounds, bids have been competitive, often exceeding perceived values significantly. Setting my bid at 8 positions me to potentially win if other bidders undervalue the prize, while minimizing my risk if the higher bids from others continue. This strategy aims to balance between maintaining a competitive presence and preserving potential profits.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 58, 55, 52, 50, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 58. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my history and the competitive nature of the bids, with perceived values often leading to high or very close second-highest bids, I'll bid 50. This aggressive yet cautious approach should give me a strong chance of winning without overpaying drastically, aiming for profit by staying under the hypothetical second-highest bid derived from patterns thus far.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 30, 29, 28, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 36 and paid 30. The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 42, and looking at the historical bids, a bid around 29 is a strategic choice. It keeps me competitive but avoids overcommitting. Previous rounds indicate that bids closer to the perceived value tend to win, but the second-highest bids also tend to be close. By bidding 29, I heighten my chances of winning while aiming to minimize potential losses if higher bids surface.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 58, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 5.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 53, 51, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 72 for this round, my aim is to bid competitively yet avoid a high overpayment. From the previous rounds, the distribution of bids has shown a trend where high bids often win but come with the risk of a slim profit margin or a loss. By selecting 55, I position myself with a strong bid likely to surpass many competitors but still retain a buffer below my perceived value of 72 to potentially secure a profit margin. This price effectively balances aggressiveness and caution, aiming to capitalize on the competitive natures observed while limiting potential losses.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 22, 20, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'With a value of 32 for this round, it's important to remain competitive while avoiding overspending. From previous rounds, bids have been quite variable, but the range often hovers around mid to high values when the perceived value is moderate to high. By bidding 25, I position myself with a strong chance of winning without overcommitting, given the pattern of previous bids. This strategy aims to capture a profit margin by keeping the bid below the perceived value and anticipating the competitive nature of other bidders.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round, I aim to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with the potential for a profit. Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster around strong mid to high ranges when perceived values are in a moderate to high band. To increase my chances of winning without risking a high overpayment, I will bid 38. This bid is aggressive enough to place me competitively based on past bidding patterns while still offering a buffer below my perceived value to aim for a profit margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 27, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 38, 35, 28, 28, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 37 and considering the historical data of past rounds, bids tend to be variable but often cluster around strong mid-ranges when perceived values are in this band. By bidding 27, I aim to be competitive without overcommitting financially. This bid is strategically conservative, intending to maximize potential profit if I win while maintaining a balance between competitiveness and avoiding an overpayment.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 60, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 50, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, the winning bids have generally been competitive, often quite high when the perceived values are also high. With a value of 79, which is the maximum possible, I need to bid aggressively to have a strong chance of winning. However, I want to ensure I still retain a considerable profit margin. By bidding 65, I am positioning myself as a strong contender while leaving enough room to profit even if I have to pay a high second-highest bid. This is a balanced approach based on previous bidding behavior and my high perceived value.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 41, 35, 28, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 40, I want to remain competitive while preventing overpayment. A review of previous rounds shows that bids aligned with mid to high ranges often secure wins but also illustrate the potential for overbidding relative to the second-highest bid. By bidding 28, I aim to position myself as a strong contender without significantly risking a steep overpayment, letting me maintain a reasonable shot at profit even with the competitive nature of other bidders.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 41, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 31, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 37, 35, 33, 30, 30, 30.

With a value of 41, I aim to position myself competitively without overpaying. A bid of 30 strategically balances the chances of winning and potentially retaining a profit margin by anticipating the competitive nature of the other bidders.

Analyzing previous rounds, winning bids that were too high led to negative profits due to overpaying. For instance, previous winning bids around the perceived value led to profits of around -4 and -5. To optimize my chances, a bid of 45 strikes a balance by being high enough to stand a competitive chance without risking significant overpayment, especially since bids above 60 have often not been profitable. Therefore, this adjusted strategy should help maximize my total profit.'

Given my high value of 77 for this round's prize, I want to bid competitively to maximize the chance of winning while still leaving a reasonable profit margin. Bidding 70 should outbid others while also ensuring good profit assuming the second-highest bid remains in the expected range based on historical data.'

The history shows previous bids range from 20 to 70, with higher perceived values eliciting higher bids. Adjusting for my lower perceived value this round, a bid of 18 is cautious yet slightly aggressive compared to past lower bids, maximizing potential profit while trying to minimize loss if outbid.'

Analyzing the history, winning bids tend to fall within the 40-70 range, and second-highest bids are often in the 30-60 range. By bidding 58, I increase my chances of winning without risking too much profit if the second-highest bid is close to my own.'

Historically, bids have ranged widely, but winning bids are often in the 40-70 range, with second-highest bids frequently in the 30-60 range.

Historical data shows bids can vary widely, but competitive bids for similar perceived values have often ranged in the 20-40 area. Given past instances where my cautious bids were close to winning, a bid of 20 should balance potential profit and loss.'

Analyzing the historical data, winning bids have generally ranged from the high 50s to low 60s when perceived values are similarly high. By bidding 61, I stay competitive and increase my chances of winning while ensuring a buffer for profit, assuming the second-highest bid is lower, which historically tends to fall within the range of 50-60.'

Historically, winning bids have ranged broadly, often dictated by perceived values. For example, in a similar range (rounds with perceived values around 30-40), winning bids have been in the 30-40 range, with second-highest bids often falling slightly below that.

From the history, I observed that the bids vary greatly and typically the second-highest bids have been around the upper 20s to mid-30s range. By bidding 20, I'm positioned conservatively, considering that while the winning bid often needs a higher value, the key information is the second-highest bid which determines the winning cost. This bid protects against overbidding and focuses on potential profit.'

From previous rounds, we observe that the winning bid is usually above 39 but not excessively high.

My perceived value is 16, which is quite low. Given that the true common value will likely be different, it's prudent to bid conservatively. Bidding 14 allows me to remain competitive in the auction while minimizing potential losses, considering the second-highest bid may still be close to my perceived value or higher.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that bids and second-highest bids can vary greatly but typically those who win have bids in the upper 40s to 70 range. The key is ensuring the bid is below my value of 60 while likely being high enough to outbid others.

The winning bids have often been around the upper half of the range, typically in the 30s to 60s, with second-highest bids often being a bit lower. Therefore, a bid of 19 is low enough to possibly secure a win without overcommitting and ensures a chance for a positive return if the second-highest bid is close to the lower end of the observed typical range.'

The highest bids have varied greatly but generally range from mid-30s to up to 70s, with second-highest bids close to the winners. A bid of 40 aims to be competitive while allowing for a profit margin assuming the second-highest bid is in the observed typical range.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 47, I want to ensure I bid strategically to maximize profit. Assuming the private values of others might be similar, I choose a bid that is reasonably lower than my value but substantial enough to outbid moderate bids from others.'

In the previous round, the highest bid was 39, so a bid of 42 should be competitive while managing the risk of overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize this round is 14, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying if the common value and other bidders' adjustments are not high. From previous rounds, I've seen competitive bids but based on my low perceived value, I aim to minimize risk. An optimal strategy here would be to bid slightly below the perceived value to ensure a chance of profit if others undervalue the prize.'

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 for this round and the observations from previous rounds, I want to place a bid that balances competitiveness with the risk of overpaying. In the initial round, competitive bids ranged around the 30s, and in subsequent rounds, there were higher bids when perceived values were high. However, I need to be cautious not to overestimate the common value. Thus, a bid of 38 is strategic; it is significant enough to compete without risking a massive loss should the second-highest bid be substantially lower.'

The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19, and considering the bids from previous rounds, the highest winning bids have varied quite widely from 6 to 70. For this round, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying, especially since the common value and other bidders' private adjustments can be quite different. By bidding 10, I take a strategic approach to potentially secure the prize without risking a large overpayment, as a bid significantly lower than my value should help manage the risk if others' bids aren't extremely high.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 68, I want to place a competitive bid while ensuring I don't overpay significantly above the second-highest bid. Based on historical data, competitive winning bids have ranged from 6 to 70. I will bid 55 as it is high enough to have a strong chance of winning while leaving some room for profit if the second-highest bid is not too close to my bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 36, 30, 30, 29, 28, 25.

The winner's profit was 2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 37, I want to strategically bid lower than my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit without overpaying. Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely with occasional high outliers. Hence, a bid of 30 positions me competitively while being below my value, balancing the competition and potential payoff.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 66, I want to place a competitive bid while minimizing the risk of overpaying significantly above the second-highest bid. Historically, competitive bids have varied widely with the highest winning bids ranging from 6 to 70. In several instances, the second-highest bids have been substantially lower than the highest bids. Strategically, a bid of 45 positions me well enough to compete effectively without risking a large loss if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 39, I want to bid strategically to balance competitiveness with profitability. In previous rounds, I've seen that winning bids have ranged widely and the key seems to be bidding just below my perceived value to maximize the chance of profit and avoid overpaying. For instance, in round 6, I bid 30 and almost won, indicating it's a competitive but cautious bid in a mid-value range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 35, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 47, 40, 40, 38, 27, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 47 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 55, and taking into account the historical bidding patterns where high bids frequently lead to minimal or negative profits, I aim to place a competitive bid without overpaying. A bid of 40 is high enough to outcompete several opponents based on prior rounds but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. This balances the risk and reward effectively given the information available.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 38, 35, 28, 28, 27. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is 48, I want to place a bid that strikes a balance between being competitive and limiting the risk of overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds suggests that bids around 30-40 often participate competitively but can result in minimal or negative profits when the bids are too high. Therefore, a bid of 35 positions me well within a competitive range while minimizing potential overpayment.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 60, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 50, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 71 and taking into consideration the historical bidding patterns, bidding around 50 appears to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overpayment. Observing past rounds, high bids often result in minimal or negative profits due to overbidding. A bid of 50 is substantial enough to outbid lower to mid-range bids but still leaves ample room for potential profit if the second-highest bid is substantially lower.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 32, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 44, 42, 41, 35, 28, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 44 and paid 42.

In previous rounds, bids around the 30-40 range have often been competitive. Additionally, high bids frequently result in minimal or negative profit due to overbidding. Therefore, bidding 35 positions me well to potentially win without risking too much loss if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 31, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 37, 35, 33, 30, 30, 30.

In previous rounds, the highest bids have often been lower than my perceived value when I bid aggressively.

Based on the previous rounds' history (which would indicate the general bidding patterns of the other bidders), bidding around 18 would give me a competitive chance to win while still aiming to maximize potential profit. The winning bid is paid to the second-highest bidder, so bidding close but not too aggressively helps to balance the risk.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 89, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 8.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60, 50, 43, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize in this round is 89, my strategy is to maximize the likelihood of winning while also ensuring I make a profit. The history indicates that bids have varied significantly. Placing a bid of 74 allows me a high probability of winning while still having a buffer for the second-highest bid to ensure profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 54, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 67, I want to place a bid that balances the likelihood of winning with ensuring a positive profit margin. Examining previous rounds, bids have ranged from the lower end (3, 6) to mid-level amounts (50-74). A bid of 54 positions me competitively without overextending, considering the second-highest bid has consistently been lower, ensuring I maintain a positive overall profit if I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is 42 and examining the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged quite widely. The first round had bids from 3 to 18, the second round from 34 to 74, and the third round from 45 to 65. To maximize my total profit, I want to place a competitive bid but not overbid in case the second-highest bid is significantly lower. Estimating a bit conservatively, a bid of 35 should give me a competitive chance to win while still aiming to keep the second-highest bid below this amount, thus ensuring a profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 26 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, a bid below 26 is advisable to ensure profitability if I win. Reviewing past bids, placing a bid around 18 maintains competitiveness while minimizing potential losses. This strategic bid aims to balance the need to win the prize with the necessity of maximizing profit by considering the likely range of second-highest bids.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 39, and reviewing the history of previous rounds where the highest bids often ranged in the mid-30s or higher but not higher than 74, I aim to bid competitively while ensuring a positive profit margin if I win. By bidding 33, I position myself with a good chance to win while keeping my potential losses low by maintaining the second-highest bid below this amount.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 27 for the prize, I want to bid just below this value to ensure I have room for profit if I win. Analyzing the previous rounds, we see the highest bids frequently exceed 30, with second-highest bids often hovering around the mid-30s. Therefore, a bid of 22 positions me as competitive without being overly aggressive. This strategy seeks to balance the likelihood of winning with the need to maintain a profit margin by ensuring the second-highest bid is below my perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35.

In previous rounds, the winning bids have generally been in the range of 33 to 74, with the second-highest bids often being significantly lower.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is quite high at 74, I should be competitive in my bidding. From the history, I see that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range when values are high. In the previous round where I had a high value (75), the highest bid was 74 and the second-highest was 65. By bidding 65, I'm aiming to win the prize by outbidding most others, yet not overbidding significantly beyond the second-highest bid based on historical data, thus maximizing my profit potential.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 57, and reflecting on the previous rounds, the bids tend to vary but the higher bids often range from 60 to 74. Given Round 2's bids from 65 to 45, and that the second-highest bids often dictate what the winner pays, bidding 45 balances competitiveness with minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to my perceived value. This strategy aims to secure a win without excessively reducing my potential profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, I want to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, high bids in the range of 50-74 tend to occur when values are significantly higher than my current value. Therefore, bidding 20 allows me to stay competitive for the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, given that I don't have a very high perceived value this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37, I aim to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history, bids vary significantly but tend to cluster higher when values are high. In previous rounds, high bids tended to significantly overshadow my current value. Hence, bidding 25 allows me to potentially secure the prize without risking a significant loss, as winning requires paying the second-highest bid which would likely be lower given my moderate perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 28, I aim to bid competitively while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, higher bids tend to occur when values are significantly above my current value. Therefore, bidding 15 allows me to stay in the running without overpaying, given the variability in bids from other players and the need to be cautious with a moderate perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, I want to bid competitively while minimizing my risk of overbidding. From the history, I observe that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range relative to the perceived value, but not necessarily the maximum perceived value. By bidding 47, I aim to balance competitiveness and caution, aiming to secure the prize without overpaying relative to the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, bidding high consistently risks overpaying without significant returns. In rounds where values were relatively low, bids varied but remained significantly below maximum perceived values. A bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to the perceived prize value.

Based on the previous rounds' history (which would indicate the general bidding patterns of the other bidders), bidding around 18 would give me a competitive chance to win while still aiming to maximize potential profit.

Examining previous rounds, bids have ranged from the lower end (3, 6) to mid-level amounts (50-74).

From the previous round, the highest bids were 74, 65, and 60, suggesting competitive bids can be quite high. However, the common value for the prize tends to be significantly lower. By bidding 50, I aim to place a competitive bid without overcommitting, increasing my chances of winning while maintaining a potential for profit if I win and the second-highest bid isn't too close.'

From past rounds, I've noticed that aggressively high bids don't guarantee a win and can result in a negative profit due to high second-highest bids. My bid of 47 aims to be competitive enough based on previous bid patterns yet controlled to maximize potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying.'

From the previous rounds, I've observed that winning bids were often within the range of 50-74, but the true common value tends to be lower, and high bids can result in negative profits. By bidding 33, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is significantly high.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 23 and previous rounds have shown that the highest bids can vary significantly, I will place a conservative bid of 19. This is lower than some of my previous bids, as my perceived value is relatively low this round. By bidding 19, I aim to increase my chances of winning without the risk of significantly overpaying compared to the second-highest bid, which has often been close to the winning bid in the past.'

Previous rounds showed that competitive bids (ranging from 50 to 74) often reflected serious contestants, but also resulted in some losses when overbid. By bidding 50, I aim to position myself strategically to win, yet avoid the possible negative profit due to high second-highest bids.'

Given my value of 68, I aim to bid sufficiently high to have a chance of winning but also accounting for a reasonable second-highest bid.

Given my value of 36 for this round, I want to bid a reasonable amount that balances the potential to win and the risk of overbidding. A bid of 25 is high enough to be competitive while minimizing the risk of paying too much if I win.'

My current value for the prize is 55, so bidding 38 provides a competitive amount that is likely to win without excessively overbidding, thereby maximizing my potential profit.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, the highest bids have varied widely, but generally, the second-highest bids have often been in the range of 30 to 65. Since my value for the prize in this round is 25, a bid of 15 balances the potential to win and the risk of bidding too high when the value is relatively low. This strategic approach helps in maximizing profit and minimizing losses.'

The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 26 and analyzing the history of previous rounds, a bid below 26 is advisable to ensure profitability if I win. Reviewing past bids, placing a bid around 18 maintains competitiveness while minimizing potential losses. This strategic bid aims to balance the need to win the prize with the necessity of maximizing profit by considering the likely range of second-highest bids.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 39, and reviewing the history of previous rounds where the highest bids often ranged in the mid-30s or higher but not higher than 74, I aim to bid competitively while ensuring a positive profit margin if I win. By bidding 33, I position myself with a good chance to win while keeping my potential losses low by maintaining the second-highest bid below this amount.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 27 for the prize, I want to bid just below this value to ensure I have room for profit if I win. Analyzing the previous rounds, we see the highest bids frequently exceed 30, with second-highest bids often hovering around the mid-30s. Therefore, a bid of 22 positions me as competitive without being overly aggressive. This strategy seeks to balance the likelihood of winning with the need to maintain a profit margin by ensuring the second-highest bid is below my perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for this round is 65, I want to balance the likelihood of winning with the need to make a profit if I do win. In previous rounds, the winning bids have generally been in the range of 33 to 74, with the second-highest bids often being significantly lower. By bidding 53, I position myself competitively to win the auction but also leave enough margin to ensure profitability if the second-highest bid is close to the trends observed in earlier rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 25, and drawing from previous rounds' history where similar perceived values saw my bids around 18 being competitive, I aim to balance my bid to be competitive while leaving room for profit if I win. Previous rounds indicate that the highest bids generally fall between the mid-20s and mid-30s, but the second-highest bids are often lower. Therefore, bidding 18 should maximize my chances while ensuring a good profit margin if I win.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -7. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12.

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22, I need to bid below this amount to ensure I make a profit if I win. Looking at the history, I see that competitive bids around or just below perceived values often provide a balance between winning and profitability. Reviewing previous rounds when my values were in a similar range (e.g., rounds 0, 4, and 6, where the bids were 18, 18, and 22 respectively), an optimal bid would fall slightly lower to increase my chances of profitability if I win.

Given my value of 53 this round, I decide to bid 50 to remain competitive while leaving room for profit.

Reviewing previous bids, they ranged from 3 to 18. Bidding 50 gives me a competitive edge while also considering the possibility of overbidding relative to the second-highest bid.

From the history, I see that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range when values are high. In the previous round where I had a high value (75), the highest bid was 74 and the second-highest was 65.

In rounds where values were relatively low, bids varied but remained significantly below maximum perceived values. A bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to the perceived prize value. This bid level also accounts for the variability in bids from other players.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 21. To maximize my profit, I will bid lower than my value to account for the possibility of overbidding and to ensure a positive profit if I win. Given that there are 5 other bidders and values are redrawn each round, bidding 15 optimizes my chances without overcommitting based on historical data from previous rounds.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60, 50, 43, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 85, I aim to bid competitively while ensuring a satisfactory profit margin. In the previous round, the highest bid was 18, significantly below the maximum possible value. By bidding 65, I increase my chances of winning and still leave room for a substantial profit, as the second-highest bid is likely to be much lower than 65.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, it is clear that bidding significantly lower than my perceived value tends to result in not winning the prize. For example, in round 1, my bid of 65 was actually competitive, though not the highest, and the second-highest bid was 65. To strike a balance between being competitive and ensuring a margin for positive profit, I will bid 61. This should increase my chances of winning while still allowing a margin for the common value to potentially provide profit after subtracting the second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Learning from previous rounds, significant bids near my perceived value lead to a higher chance of winning but also higher risk of reduced profit or loss. Given my value of 53 this round, I decide to bid 50 to remain competitive while leaving room for profit. Previous winning bids ranged mid to high, and by bidding 50, I anticipate a good balance of competitiveness and a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, I will bid 35 to ensure a competitive yet strategic bid. In previous rounds, the highest bids have varied widely. Bidding 35 minimizes the risk of significant loss while maintaining a competitive stance to possibly win with a margin that would still offer potential profit when the payment is the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize, I need to bid competitively but still leave room for potential profit. In previous rounds, bids have ranged widely, and winning bids ranged from 6 to 74. The most recent rounds have shown second-highest bids being only a few units less than the highest bid. By bidding 32, I position myself competitively while aiming for a margin where the second-highest bid (if I win) could still allow me some profit based on expected common value deductions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 32 and learning from the history of previous rounds, I noticed that bids lower than the perceived value often lead to a reduced risk of loss. By bidding 28, I aim to remain competitive while leaving a margin for potential profit. Previous rounds showed that bidding close to the perceived value often results in a loss due to overbidding. Thus, 28 balances competitiveness with a cautious approach to avoid losses.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 67, previous rounds\u2019 history indicates that bidding slightly lower remains competitive while minimizing the risk of significant loss. For example, in round 2, a bid of 65 won with a second-highest bid of 61, and in subsequent rounds, similar patterns emerged. Bidding 61 allows me to stay competitive and potentially gain a profit margin if the second-highest bid falls into a similar range as previous rounds.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 11, I aim to bid just below this value to boost my chances of winning at a decent rate while minimizing potential loss. Reviewing past rounds, lower bids around or slightly below the perceived value often lead to securing the prize without significant loss and sometimes even small profit margins. Bidding 8 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12, and considering the history of previous rounds where lower bids close to or slightly below the value often reduce the risk of significant loss, I will bid 8. This strategy balances being competitive and minimizing potential loss due to overbidding, especially when the perceived value is relatively low.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for the prize and previous rounds' history, I will bid 60 to ensure competitiveness while minimizing potential losses. In prior rounds, lower bids tended to reduce risks of significant losses while still having a chance to win. Bidding 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 61 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for the prize in this round, I choose to bid more aggressively. From the history, we see a range of bids with the highest being 18, which suggests that others are bidding conservatively. By bidding 43, I aim to secure the prize while still potentially benefitting from a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my profit margin.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 70 for the prize this round, I choose to bid 50. In previous rounds, the highest bid was 74 and the second highest was 65 when I bid 43. These results suggest that bidding in a mid-range allows a chance of winning while not overbidding relative to the second-highest bid. Bidding 50 aims to balance between being competitive and ensuring a reasonable profit if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 45 for the prize this round, I choose to bid 30. In previous rounds, the highest bids have often been lower than my perceived value when I bid aggressively. By bidding 30, I aim to stay competitive without overbidding relative to the second-highest bid.

From the history of previous rounds, I've observed that more aggressive bids often result in losses or minimal profits due to the second-highest bid being relatively close to the highest bid. By bidding 25, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying, thereby increasing my overall expected profit over multiple rounds.'

Bidding too low, however, almost guarantees not winning the prize. My strategy of bidding 12 aims to stay conservative yet competitive, optimizing the likelihood of securing the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying and enhancing my overall expected profit over multiple rounds.'

My historical bids varied based on perceived value, and previous bids around 50 tended to be well-placed, respectively. By bidding 50, I can stay competitive while managing the risk of overpaying due to the potential proximity of the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is quite high at 74, I should be competitive in my bidding. From the history, I see that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range when values are high. In the previous round where I had a high value (75), the highest bid was 74 and the second-highest was 65. By bidding 65, I'm aiming to win the prize by outbidding most others, yet not overbidding significantly beyond the second-highest bid based on historical data, thus maximizing my profit potential.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 57, and reflecting on the previous rounds, the bids tend to vary but the higher bids often range from 60 to 74. Given Round 2's bids from 65 to 45, and that the second-highest bids often dictate what the winner pays, bidding 45 balances competitiveness with minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to my perceived value. This strategy aims to secure a win without excessively reducing my potential profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 31, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, I want to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, high bids in the range of 50-74 tend to occur when values are significantly higher than my current value. Therefore, bidding 20 allows me to stay competitive for the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, given that I don't have a very high perceived value this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37, I aim to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history, bids vary significantly but tend to cluster higher when values are high. In previous rounds, high bids tended to significantly overshadow my current value. Hence, bidding 25 allows me to potentially secure the prize without risking a significant loss, as winning requires paying the second-highest bid which would likely be lower given my moderate perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 28, I aim to bid competitively while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, higher bids tend to occur when values are significantly above my current value. Therefore, bidding 15 allows me to stay in the running without overpaying, given the variability in bids from other players and the need to be cautious with a moderate perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, I want to bid competitively while minimizing my risk of overbidding. From the history, I observe that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range relative to the perceived value, but not necessarily the maximum perceived value. By bidding 47, I aim to balance competitiveness and caution, aiming to secure the prize without overpaying relative to the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 14, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, bidding high consistently risks overpaying without significant returns. In rounds where values were relatively low, bids varied but remained significantly below maximum perceived values. A bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to the perceived prize value. This bid level also accounts for the variability in bids from other players.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12.

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 23, and examining the history, when the perceived values were relatively low, bids generally clustered below 25. Bidding 12 allows me to stay competitive without risking excessive loss, considering my moderate perceived value and the potential variability in other players' bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 57, and reviewing the history of previous rounds, high bids when values were significant generally ranged between 45 to 74. To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, bidding 45 provides a balance between being competitive and cautious, since the winner often ends up paying close to the second-highest bid, which tends to be lower. This bid level takes into account the variability in other players' bids and aims to secure the prize without excessively high payments.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 45, 40, 40, 35.

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, it is clear that bidding significantly lower than my perceived value tends to result in not winning the prize. For example, in round 1, my bid of 65 was actually competitive, though not the highest, and the second-highest bid was 65. To strike a balance between being competitive and ensuring a margin for positive profit, I will bid 61. This should increase my chances of winning while still allowing a margin for the common value to potentially provide profit after subtracting the second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Learning from previous rounds, significant bids near my perceived value lead to a higher chance of winning but also higher risk of reduced profit or loss. Given my value of 53 this round, I decide to bid 50 to remain competitive while leaving room for profit. Previous winning bids ranged mid to high, and by bidding 50, I anticipate a good balance of competitiveness and a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, I will bid 35 to ensure a competitive yet strategic bid. In previous rounds, the highest bids have varied widely. Bidding 35 minimizes the risk of significant loss while maintaining a competitive stance to possibly win with a margin that would still offer potential profit when the payment is the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize, I need to bid competitively but still leave room for potential profit. In previous rounds, bids have ranged widely, and winning bids ranged from 6 to 74. The most recent rounds have shown second-highest bids being only a few units less than the highest bid. By bidding 32, I position myself competitively while aiming for a margin where the second-highest bid (if I win) could still allow me some profit based on expected common value deductions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 32 and learning from the history of previous rounds, I noticed that bids lower than the perceived value often lead to a reduced risk of loss. By bidding 28, I aim to remain competitive while leaving a margin for potential profit. Previous rounds showed that bidding close to the perceived value often results in a loss due to overbidding. Thus, 28 balances competitiveness with a cautious approach to avoid losses.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 67, previous rounds\u2019 history indicates that bidding slightly lower remains competitive while minimizing the risk of significant loss. For example, in round 2, a bid of 65 won with a second-highest bid of 61, and in subsequent rounds, similar patterns emerged. Bidding 61 allows me to stay competitive and potentially gain a profit margin if the second-highest bid falls into a similar range as previous rounds.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 11, I aim to bid just below this value to boost my chances of winning at a decent rate while minimizing potential loss. Reviewing past rounds, lower bids around or slightly below the perceived value often lead to securing the prize without significant loss and sometimes even small profit margins. Bidding 8 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12, and considering the history of previous rounds where lower bids close to or slightly below the value often reduce the risk of significant loss, I will bid 8. This strategy balances being competitive and minimizing potential loss due to overbidding, especially when the perceived value is relatively low.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for the prize and previous rounds' history, I will bid 60 to ensure competitiveness while minimizing potential losses. In prior rounds, lower bids tended to reduce risks of significant losses while still having a chance to win. Bidding 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 45, 40, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, bidding slightly below the perceived value tends to balance competitiveness and risk management. In this round, my perceived value is 61. To maximize my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I will bid 55. This approach has shown to be effective in past rounds where similar strategies often resulted in winning the bid without significant losses, and provides a cushion considering the second-highest bids tend to fall within a narrower range.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 46 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is quite high at 74, I should be competitive in my bidding. From the history, I see that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range when values are high. In the previous round where I had a high value (75), the highest bid was 74 and the second-highest was 65. By bidding 65, I'm aiming to win the prize by outbidding most others, yet not overbidding significantly beyond the second-highest bid based on historical data, thus maximizing my profit potential.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 57, and reflecting on the previous rounds, the bids tend to vary but the higher bids often range from 60 to 74. Given Round 2's bids from 65 to 45, and that the second-highest bids often dictate what the winner pays, bidding 45 balances competitiveness with minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to my perceived value. This strategy aims to secure a win without excessively reducing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, I want to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, high bids in the range of 50-74 tend to occur when values are significantly higher than my current value. Therefore, bidding 20 allows me to stay competitive for the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, given that I don't have a very high perceived value this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 37, I aim to bid competitively without overbidding. Reviewing the history, bids vary significantly but tend to cluster higher when values are high. In previous rounds, high bids tended to significantly overshadow my current value. Hence, bidding 25 allows me to potentially secure the prize without risking a significant loss, as winning requires paying the second-highest bid which would likely be lower given my moderate perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 28, I aim to bid competitively while minimizing the risk of overbidding. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, higher bids tend to occur when values are significantly above my current value. Therefore, bidding 15 allows me to stay in the running without overpaying, given the variability in bids from other players and the need to be cautious with a moderate perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, I want to bid competitively while minimizing my risk of overbidding. From the history, I observe that winning bids tend to cluster in the higher range relative to the perceived value, but not necessarily the maximum perceived value. By bidding 47, I aim to balance competitiveness and caution, aiming to secure the prize without overpaying relative to the second-highest bid, thus maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 14 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, bidding high consistently risks overpaying without significant returns. In rounds where values were relatively low, bids varied but remained significantly below maximum perceived values. A bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to the perceived prize value. This bid level also accounts for the variability in bids from other players.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12.

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 23, and examining the history, when the perceived values were relatively low, bids generally clustered below 25. Bidding 12 allows me to stay competitive without risking excessive loss, considering my moderate perceived value and the potential variability in other players' bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 57, and reviewing the history of previous rounds, high bids when values were significant generally ranged between 45 to 74. To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, bidding 45 provides a balance between being competitive and cautious, since the winner often ends up paying close to the second-highest bid, which tends to be lower. This bid level takes into account the variability in other players' bids and aims to secure the prize without excessively high payments.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 45, 40, 40, 35.

The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 53 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, bids have varied greatly depending on perceived values, often clustering higher when values are significant. Bidding 45 provides a competitive edge while minimizing the risk of overbidding. This strategy aims to balance competitiveness with caution, ensuring I don't overpay relative to the second-highest bid, which often tends to be lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 21. To maximize my profit, I will bid lower than my value to account for the possibility of overbidding and to ensure a positive profit if I win. Given that there are 5 other bidders and values are redrawn each round, bidding 15 optimizes my chances without overcommitting based on historical data from previous rounds.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60, 50, 43, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 85, I aim to bid competitively while ensuring a satisfactory profit margin. In the previous round, the highest bid was 18, significantly below the maximum possible value. By bidding 65, I increase my chances of winning and still leave room for a substantial profit, as the second-highest bid is likely to be much lower than 65.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, it is clear that bidding significantly lower than my perceived value tends to result in not winning the prize. For example, in round 1, my bid of 65 was actually competitive, though not the highest, and the second-highest bid was 65. To strike a balance between being competitive and ensuring a margin for positive profit, I will bid 61. This should increase my chances of winning while still allowing a margin for the common value to potentially provide profit after subtracting the second-highest bid.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Learning from previous rounds, significant bids near my perceived value lead to a higher chance of winning but also higher risk of reduced profit or loss. Given my value of 53 this round, I decide to bid 50 to remain competitive while leaving room for profit. Previous winning bids ranged mid to high, and by bidding 50, I anticipate a good balance of competitiveness and a positive profit margin if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 22, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -11.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 33, 25, 20, 20, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, I will bid 35 to ensure a competitive yet strategic bid. In previous rounds, the highest bids have varied widely. Bidding 35 minimizes the risk of significant loss while maintaining a competitive stance to possibly win with a margin that would still offer potential profit when the payment is the second-highest bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 36, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 43, 38, 33, 32, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize, I need to bid competitively but still leave room for potential profit. In previous rounds, bids have ranged widely, and winning bids ranged from 6 to 74. The most recent rounds have shown second-highest bids being only a few units less than the highest bid. By bidding 32, I position myself competitively while aiming for a margin where the second-highest bid (if I win) could still allow me some profit based on expected common value deductions.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 32 and learning from the history of previous rounds, I noticed that bids lower than the perceived value often lead to a reduced risk of loss. By bidding 28, I aim to remain competitive while leaving a margin for potential profit. Previous rounds showed that bidding close to the perceived value often results in a loss due to overbidding. Thus, 28 balances competitiveness with a cautious approach to avoid losses.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 67, previous rounds\u2019 history indicates that bidding slightly lower remains competitive while minimizing the risk of significant loss. For example, in round 2, a bid of 65 won with a second-highest bid of 61, and in subsequent rounds, similar patterns emerged. Bidding 61 allows me to stay competitive and potentially gain a profit margin if the second-highest bid falls into a similar range as previous rounds.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 11, I aim to bid just below this value to boost my chances of winning at a decent rate while minimizing potential loss. Reviewing past rounds, lower bids around or slightly below the perceived value often lead to securing the prize without significant loss and sometimes even small profit margins. Bidding 8 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 12, you bid 8, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 12, and considering the history of previous rounds where lower bids close to or slightly below the value often reduce the risk of significant loss, I will bid 8. This strategy balances being competitive and minimizing potential loss due to overbidding, especially when the perceived value is relatively low.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for the prize and previous rounds' history, I will bid 60 to ensure competitiveness while minimizing potential losses. In prior rounds, lower bids tended to reduce risks of significant losses while still having a chance to win. Bidding 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 61, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 45, 40, 40, 35.

In this round, my perceived value is 61. To maximize my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I will bid 55. This approach has shown to be effective in past rounds where similar strategies often resulted in winning the bid without significant losses, and provides a cushion considering the second-highest bids tend to fall within a narrower range.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 35, 30.

Previous rounds suggest that the highest bids often exceed 30, but keeping it below my perceived value ensures I don't overspend if I win.

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 53', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 3, 18, 15, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 27 for the prize, I choose to bid somewhat conservatively, risking a fraction of my potential profit to reduce the chance of overpaying relative to the second-highest bid. This strategy allows for the possibility of securing the prize at a reasonable cost, enhancing my overall expected profit over the rounds.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 65, 60, 50, 43, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for the prize in this round, I choose to bid more aggressively. From the history, we see a range of bids with the highest being 18, which suggests that others are bidding conservatively. By bidding 43, I aim to secure the prize while still potentially benefitting from a lower second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my profit margin.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 56, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 54, 50, 50, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 70 for the prize this round, I choose to bid 50. In previous rounds, the highest bid was 74 and the second highest was 65 when I bid 43. These results suggest that bidding in a mid-range allows a chance of winning while not overbidding relative to the second-highest bid. Bidding 50 aims to balance between being competitive and ensuring a reasonable profit if I win.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 45, 40, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 47. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 45 for the prize this round, I choose to bid 30. In previous rounds, the highest bids have often been lower than my perceived value when I bid aggressively. By bidding 30, I aim to stay competitive without overbidding relative to the second-highest bid. This strategy should help maximize my profit by balancing the likelihood of winning against the potential cost of overpayment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 33. The winner's profit was -11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 33 for the prize this round, I choose to bid conservatively at 20. In previous rounds, I've observed that higher bids often result in a loss or minimal profit due to the second-highest bid's proximity to the highest. By bidding 20, I aim to stay competitive while reducing the risk of overpaying, thereby maximizing my profit over the long term.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 43 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for the prize this round, I choose to bid 25. From the history of previous rounds, I've observed that more aggressive bids often result in losses or minimal profits due to the second-highest bid being relatively close to the highest bid. By bidding 25, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying, thereby increasing my overall expected profit over multiple rounds.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I choose to bid 35. From the history of previous rounds, more aggressive bids have often resulted in minimal profit or losses due to the second-highest bid being relatively close. By bidding 35, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying, thus maximizing my profit over multiple rounds.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 9 for the prize this round, I choose to bid conservatively at 5. From the history of previous rounds, I have observed that aggressive bids often result in minimal profit due to the second-highest bid being relatively close. By bidding 5, I aim to minimize the risk of overpaying while still maintaining a chance to secure the prize at a cost lower than my value, thereby optimizing my overall profit over multiple rounds.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for the prize this round, and from analyzing the history of previous rounds, it is evident that higher bids often result in minimal profit or even losses due to the close proximity of the second-highest bid. Bidding too low, however, almost guarantees not winning the prize. My strategy of bidding 12 aims to stay conservative yet competitive, optimizing the likelihood of securing the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying and enhancing my overall expected profit over multiple rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 72 and the history of previous rounds, I will aim for a strategic balance between being competitive and avoiding overpayment. My historical bids varied based on perceived value, and previous bids around 50 tended to be well-placed, respectively. By bidding 50, I can stay competitive while managing the risk of overpaying due to the potential proximity of the second-highest bid.'

A bid around 40 is competitive enough to increase my chances of winning, yet conservative enough to decrease the risk of overpaying. This strategy aims to balance the likelihood of securing the prize with the potential payout relative to the second-highest bid, thereby optimizing my total profit over the entire game.'

In rounds where values were relatively low, bids varied but remained significantly below maximum perceived values. A bid of 10 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overbidding relative to the perceived prize value. This bid level also accounts for the variability in bids from other players.'

To maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, bidding 45 provides a balance between being competitive and cautious, since the winner often ends up paying close to the second-highest bid, which tends to be lower. This bid level takes into account the variability in other players' bids and aims to secure the prize without excessively high payments.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My perceived value for this round is 58. Based on the previous rounds' data, bids generally tend to be conservative, often not reaching the high end of the perceived value spectrum. By bidding 48, I aim to be competitive enough to win while leaving room for a good profit margin. If the second-highest bid aligns with the trends observed in previous rounds, I should achieve a positive profit margin by not overextending my bid.'

Given my value of 53 this round, I decide to bid 50 to remain competitive while leaving room for profit.

For example, in round 2, a bid of 65 won with a second-highest bid of 61, and in subsequent rounds, similar patterns emerged. Bidding 61 allows me to stay competitive and potentially gain a profit margin if the second-highest bid falls into a similar range as previous rounds.'

Reviewing past rounds, lower bids around or slightly below the perceived value often lead to securing the prize without significant loss and sometimes even small profit margins. Bidding 8 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.'

In prior rounds, lower bids tended to reduce risks of significant losses while still having a chance to win. Bidding 60 strikes a balance between competitiveness and conservative risk management.'

In this round, my perceived value is 61. To maximize my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I will bid 55. This approach has shown to be effective in past rounds where similar strategies often resulted in winning the bid without significant losses, and provides a cushion considering the second-highest bids tend to fall within a narrower range.'

In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 28, 22, 22, 19, 15, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 28 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 23 and previous rounds have shown that the highest bids can vary significantly, I will place a conservative bid of 19. This is lower than some of my previous bids, as my perceived value is relatively low this round. By bidding 19, I aim to increase my chances of winning without the risk of significantly overpaying compared to the second-highest bid, which has often been close to the winning bid in the past.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 53, 50, 47, 41, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 53. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 62 and analyzing the past bidding patterns, it is clear that placing too low a bid may reduce my chances of winning, while placing too high a bid risks overpaying if the second-highest bid is close to mine. Previous rounds showed that competitive bids (ranging from 50 to 74) often reflected serious contestants, but also resulted in some losses when overbid. By bidding 50, I aim to position myself strategically to win, yet avoid the possible negative profit due to high second-highest bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 8, 5, 20, 18, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 28 and considering the patterns observed in previous rounds where aggressive bids often result in negative profits, I'll place a cautious yet competitive bid this round. In previous rounds, bids around the mid-20s range are relatively safe and could secure a winning position without excessively overpaying. By bidding 20, I aim to balance my chances of winning with the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is close to my bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 20, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 5, 17, 15, 12, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 20 for the prize and analyzing the patterns from the previous rounds, high bids often result in negative profits, especially if the second-highest bid is close. Since my perceived value is quite low, I aim to place a conservative bid of 15 to increase my chances of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is close.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 53, 50, 47, 46, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 53. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 56 and reviewing the history of previous rounds, I observe that placing too high a bid could result in negative profits if the second-highest bid is close. The perceived values and bids can vary significantly; however, bidding around 47 provides a balance between being competitive and avoiding overpaying based on observed bid patterns from other players.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 66, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -8.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 55, 45, 40, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 66, I need to balance competitiveness with the need to avoid overpaying based on the history of past rounds. Previous highest winning bids have varied but tend to be around the 50-60 range, often resulting in negative profits if the second-highest bid is close. By bidding 55, I aim to stay competitive with a chance to win while minimizing the risk of a high payment if the second-highest bid is not much lower.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 47, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 35, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 47 and observing the bidding behavior in previous rounds, higher bids often result in lower or negative profits due to the high variability in second-highest bids. A more conservative bid around 38 strikes a balance between being competitive and minimizing the risk of overpaying, thus optimizing my chances for a positive profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 66, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -20. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 66, 65, 62, 60, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 75, I want to bid high enough to improve my chances of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is close. Analyzing previous rounds, competitive bids often range between 50-65 in high-value rounds. Bidding 66 balances between staying competitively high while not excessively overbidding, aiming to secure the prize with a positive profit margin if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 43 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.
