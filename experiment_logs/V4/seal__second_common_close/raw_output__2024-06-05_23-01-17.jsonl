Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.'

I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 31, I want to bid slightly lower to increase the probability of getting the prize at a competitive cost. By bidding 25, I aim to stay competitive without overpaying, considering there's also a risk of losing to higher bids.'

In round 0, I noticed a close competition even with lower perceived values. Bidding 72 should position me competitively, aiming to win without overpaying, as higher bids would reduce my net profit.

In past rounds, the highest bids have varied significantly, with values like 73 and 79.

The previous rounds have shown other bidders bidding fairly conservatively in some cases (with bids as low as 18), so bidding 15 might give me a chance to win without risking too much relative to my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 75 this round, and observing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it seems that a bid in the 60-70 range is competitive. To maximize my chances of winning while still leaving room for profit, I decided to bid 65. This amount is above the midpoint of previous high bids but still lower than my perceived value, ensuring there's potential for a positive profit margin if I win.'

From the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged between 52 and 79 when the values are high.

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 26 this round, I want to bid conservatively to ensure a margin for profit while considering the variability in others' bids. Historical data suggests winning bids vary, but bidding lower increases my chance of yielding a profit if I win.'

In previous rounds, the highest bids were 30, 79, and 5, with the second-highest bids being 25, 75, and 18. Considering this variability and aiming to avoid overpaying, bidding 70 should secure a win while leaving enough margin to make a profit, assuming the second-highest bid is lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 82 this round, my strategy is to aim for a balance between winning the auction and maximizing profit. Previous rounds have shown that winning bids tend to range from 5 to 79, with the second-highest bids being slightly below the winning bids. Bidding 72 should provide a strong chance of winning while leaving enough margin to make a profit based on the expected second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 85 this round, my strategy is to maximize profit while ensuring a strong chance of winning. Previous rounds' highest bids ranged widely from 5 to 79, with more recent rounds showing higher bids often around 70-73. Assuming the second-highest bid is in a similar range, bidding 75 provides a good balance of securing the win without overpaying too much, thus leaving some room for profit.'

From historical data, the winning bids have varied, with common values influencing final profits. Given previous bids such as 72, 75, and 80 leading or trailing near the top, I aim to stay competitive but avoid overpaying.

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 88 for the prize, my goal is to maximize my profit by winning the prize. Based on the previous round, it appears that the winning bid was higher than my previous bid of 25 and the second-highest bid was also close. To ensure I have a high chance of winning, I'll bid close to my value but slightly undervalue it to maximize my overall profit minus payments. A bid of 79 should give me a strong chance to win without overpaying.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 10 in this round, and based on the history of previous rounds where winning bids were quite higher, it is unlikely that I'll win with a bid close to my value. Therefore, I'll bid conservatively at 5 to minimize my loss while staying somewhat competitive. This strategy will preserve my profit while considering the low probability of winning with a high bid in this round.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 73, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 73, 72, 70, 70, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 78 for the prize, I aim to maximize my profit while considering the bids from previous rounds. Based on previous rounds, high bids that are close to the maximum value have won. By bidding 73, I aim to win potentially without overpaying, assuming competitors might bid lower but still competitively.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69 for this round, I want to maximize my profit while taking into account the bid amounts from previous rounds. Historically, high bids have been positioned close to but not necessarily at the perceived value. By bidding 65, I'm keeping my bid competitive and giving myself a good chance to win without overpaying significantly, thus aiming for a favorable balance of risk and reward.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 1.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 74, 67, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 85 for the prize, I want to maximize my profit while learning from the history of previous rounds. The winning bids in the past rounds were 30, 79, 5, 73, and 72, with the second-highest bids being relatively close. Since this round has a significantly high value for me, I'll bid 80, which is slightly below my perceived value but high enough to increase my chances of winning without overpaying too much.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 67, 60, 60, 58.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for the prize and learning from the past rounds, I notice that bids close to the perceived values tend to win, but also considering the variance in bids between players. By bidding 67, which is slightly below my perceived value, I aim to remain competitive without overpaying, increasing my chances of maintaining or improving my total profit position.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, where lower perceived values resulted in my more conservative bids, I'll aim to bid significantly lower to maximize potential profit if I do win while minimizing losses if I don't. A bid of 11 should strike a cautious but competitive balance considering that my perceived value is not very high.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 43 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

This strategy helps to ensure I am not overpaying if I win, and it also accounts for other bidders potentially having higher values and/or bidding aggressively. Given the variability in adjustments and assuming a conservative approach, a bid of 18 strikes a good balance.'

Given the new drawn value of 80 for this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning while minimizing overpayment. A bid of 60 is significantly higher than previous highest bids, likely ensuring I win the prize, but it's also well below my perceived value ensuring a safety margin for profit.'

Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.'

I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while still keeping a substantial margin below my perceived value to ensure profitability if I win.

The history shows that the highest bids often occur around high perceived values and aggressive bidding. By bidding 52, I increase my chances of winning while keeping a significant margin below my value, aiming for a good balance between competitiveness and potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Drawing from the history of previous rounds, I've observed that high perceived values are often met with fairly aggressive bidding, resulting in winning bids often falling in the range of high 60s to low 70s. Given my value for this round is 79, a strategic bid of 58 strikes a balance between potentially winning the prize and keeping a safety margin to secure profit by avoiding overpayment.'

Based on previous rounds, competitive bids often fall within the high range when perceived values are high. However, for a low perceived value, bidding just slightly above zero provides a chance of winning only if others also have very low perceived values.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize profit, I will bid slightly lower than my perceived value of 28. This strategy helps to ensure I am not overpaying if I win, and it also accounts for other bidders potentially having higher values and/or bidding aggressively. Given the variability in adjustments and assuming a conservative approach, a bid of 18 strikes a good balance.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 75, 68, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history from the previous round, the highest bid was 30, and the second-highest bid was 25. Given the new drawn value of 80 for this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning while minimizing overpayment. A bid of 60 is significantly higher than previous highest bids, likely ensuring I win the prize, but it's also well below my perceived value ensuring a safety margin for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I observed that other bidders tend to bid aggressively when the value is relatively high. Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high perceived value of 90 and learning from previous rounds, a higher bid is warranted. I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while still keeping a substantial margin below my perceived value to ensure profitability if I win. This strategy of balancing competitiveness and cost efficiency aligns with patterns seen in previous rounds.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 and the bidding patterns from previous rounds, I want to balance the likelihood of winning with the risk of overpaying. The history shows that the highest bids often occur around high perceived values and aggressive bidding. By bidding 52, I increase my chances of winning while keeping a significant margin below my value, aiming for a good balance between competitiveness and potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Drawing from the history of previous rounds, I've observed that high perceived values are often met with fairly aggressive bidding, resulting in winning bids often falling in the range of high 60s to low 70s. Given my value for this round is 79, a strategic bid of 58 strikes a balance between potentially winning the prize and keeping a safety margin to secure profit by avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 67, 60, 60, 58.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72 and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds where higher values often resulted in bids in the high 60s to low 70s, a bid of 60 balances between being competitive and avoiding overpayment, aiming to increase the likelihood of winning while securing a reasonable profit margin.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 15, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is relatively low at 8, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying and incurring significant losses. Based on previous rounds, competitive bids often fall within the high range when perceived values are high. However, for a low perceived value, bidding just slightly above zero provides a chance of winning only if others also have very low perceived values. A bid of 5 balances a low risk with a small opportunity to win the prize without overextending.'

In round 0, I noticed a close competition even with lower perceived values. Bidding 72 should position me competitively, aiming to win without overpaying, as higher bids would reduce my net profit.

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 33', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 26, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 25, 25, 18. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize profit, I will bid slightly lower than my perceived value of 28. This strategy helps to ensure I am not overpaying if I win, and it also accounts for other bidders potentially having higher values and/or bidding aggressively. Given the variability in adjustments and assuming a conservative approach, a bid of 18 strikes a good balance.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 75, 68, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the history from the previous round, the highest bid was 30, and the second-highest bid was 25. Given the new drawn value of 80 for this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning while minimizing overpayment. A bid of 60 is significantly higher than previous highest bids, likely ensuring I win the prize, but it's also well below my perceived value ensuring a safety margin for profit.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 23, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I observed that other bidders tend to bid aggressively when the value is relatively high. Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 90, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 73, 72, 70, 70, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high perceived value of 90 and learning from previous rounds, a higher bid is warranted. I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while still keeping a substantial margin below my perceived value to ensure profitability if I win. This strategy of balancing competitiveness and cost efficiency aligns with patterns seen in previous rounds.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 68, 65, 65, 52. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 and the bidding patterns from previous rounds, I want to balance the likelihood of winning with the risk of overpaying. The history shows that the highest bids often occur around high perceived values and aggressive bidding. By bidding 52, I increase my chances of winning while keeping a significant margin below my value, aiming for a good balance between competitiveness and potential profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 75, 74, 67, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Drawing from the history of previous rounds, I've observed that high perceived values are often met with fairly aggressive bidding, resulting in winning bids often falling in the range of high 60s to low 70s. Given my value for this round is 79, a strategic bid of 58 strikes a balance between potentially winning the prize and keeping a safety margin to secure profit by avoiding overpayment.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 67, 60, 60, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 67. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72 and analyzing the bid patterns from previous rounds where higher values often resulted in bids in the high 60s to low 70s, a bid of 60 balances between being competitive and avoiding overpayment, aiming to increase the likelihood of winning while securing a reasonable profit margin.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 15, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is relatively low at 8, I need to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying and incurring significant losses. Based on previous rounds, competitive bids often fall within the high range when perceived values are high. However, for a low perceived value, bidding just slightly above zero provides a chance of winning only if others also have very low perceived values. A bid of 5 balances a low risk with a small opportunity to win the prize without overextending.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 33, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 48 and drawing from previous rounds where bids tend to be clustered around the mid to high range when values are perceived to be higher, a bid of 40 provides a competitive stance while maintaining a reasonable margin below my perceived value to avoid overpaying. This strategy aims to balance the chance of winning with the goal of ensuring profitability if I succeed.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 10, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 and reflecting on the history of previous rounds, low perceived values usually result in conservative bidding. In rounds where perceived values were low, successful bids were close to the lower end of the bid range. A bid of 5 optimizes my chances of potentially winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This approach balances the likelihood of winning with the goal of maintaining total profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 33 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69 for this round, I want to maximize my profit while taking into account the bid amounts from previous rounds. Historically, high bids have been positioned close to but not necessarily at the perceived value. By bidding 65, I'm keeping my bid competitive and giving myself a good chance to win without overpaying significantly, thus aiming for a favorable balance of risk and reward.'

The winning bids in the past rounds were 30, 79, 5, 73, and 72, with the second-highest bids being relatively close. Since this round has a significantly high value for me, I'll bid 80, which is slightly below my perceived value but high enough to increase my chances of winning without overpaying too much.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 67, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 67, 60, 60, 58.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for the prize and learning from the past rounds, I notice that bids close to the perceived values tend to win, but also considering the variance in bids between players. By bidding 67, which is slightly below my perceived value, I aim to remain competitive without overpaying, increasing my chances of maintaining or improving my total profit position.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, where lower perceived values resulted in my more conservative bids, I'll aim to bid significantly lower to maximize potential profit if I do win while minimizing losses if I don't. A bid of 11 should strike a cautious but competitive balance considering that my perceived value is not very high.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 33, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 33, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 43 for the prize this round, and learning from previous rounds where bids close to my perceived value tend to win, I aim to bid slightly lower than my value to balance winning the auction and ensuring a profit. Bidding 38 gives me a competitive chance without overpaying.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 12, 10.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 16 for this round, and analyzing previous rounds, it appears that conservative bids tend to minimize losses, especially when the perceived value is relatively low. Bidding 12 should balance the chance of winning with the aim of not overpaying, based on the historical data where winning bids were close to but not exceeding perceived values significantly.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 32, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 29, 28, 22, 20.

Historical data shows significant variation in winning and second-highest bids but tends to cluster with high values occasionally reaching around 70-80. A bid of 33 positions me competitively below previous high ranges while still offering a margin to profit should the second-highest bid be lower.'

Historical data suggests that bids and perceived values vary widely, often with winning bids significantly higher. Thus, bidding 5 provides a chance at winning with minimal risk of making a loss, assuming the second-highest bid is not too far above my perceived value.'

This strategy helps to ensure I am not overpaying if I win, and it also accounts for other bidders potentially having higher values and/or bidding aggressively. Given the variability in adjustments and assuming a conservative approach, a bid of 18 strikes a good balance.'

Given the new drawn value of 80 for this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning while minimizing overpayment. A bid of 60 is significantly higher than previous highest bids, likely ensuring I win the prize, but it's also well below my perceived value ensuring a safety margin for profit.'

Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.'

I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while still keeping a substantial margin below my perceived value to ensure profitability if I win.

Based on previous rounds, competitive bids often fall within the high range when perceived values are high. However, for a low perceived value, bidding just slightly above zero provides a chance of winning only if others also have very low perceived values.

In previous rounds, the highest bids were 30, 79, and 5, with the second-highest bids being 25, 75, and 18.

From historical data, the winning bids have varied, with common values influencing final profits. Given previous bids such as 72, 75, and 80 leading or trailing near the top, I aim to stay competitive but avoid overpaying. Bidding 60 positions me well to win without large overpayments, assuming the second-highest bid trends around the lower recent patterns.'

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids often cluster around mid-range values when perceived values vary, with the second-highest bid frequently slightly lower. By bidding 35, I position myself competitively to win while ensuring enough margin for profit if the second-highest bid aligns with typical patterns seen so far.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 40, I want to bid an amount that allows for a good chance of winning without paying too much relative to the prize's value. Bidding 30 gives me a margin to profit if I win, assuming second highest bid will be near this amount.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite high at 83, I want to bid competitively to maximize my chances of winning. From the previous round, the bids ranged from 18 to 30, so bidding 60 should be high enough to outbid others while still leaving room for profit even if the second-highest bid is somewhat lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 24 in this round, aiming for a bid lower than my perceived value can minimize potential losses. The previous rounds have shown other bidders bidding fairly conservatively in some cases (with bids as low as 18), so bidding 15 might give me a chance to win without risking too much relative to my perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 88, I want to bid competitively but also leave room for profit. In previous rounds, bids reached as high as 79 and as low as 5. By bidding 70, I place myself in a strong position to win while hopefully paying less than my perceived value and maximizing profit.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 75 this round, and observing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it seems that a bid in the 60-70 range is competitive. To maximize my chances of winning while still leaving room for profit, I decided to bid 65. This amount is above the midpoint of previous high bids but still lower than my perceived value, ensuring there's potential for a positive profit margin if I win.'

From the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged between 52 and 79 when the values are high. By bidding 67, I place myself in a strong position to possibly win the prize while keeping my bid lower than my perceived value, which allows for a better chance of making a profit based on the second highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 67. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 82 this round, and learning from the history of previous rounds where bids tend to be in the range of 60-79 for high values, I will bid 72. This bid is competitively high but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. It also aligns with the pattern of bids observed in prior rounds for similar perceived values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value for the prize is 28, I will bid conservatively to maximize my potential profit while ensuring that my loss, if any, is minimized. Previously, I have noticed that lower bids can sometimes win due to the variability in others' perceived values and bids, especially when overall values can range widely. A bid of 15 gives me an opportunity to possibly win at a lower payout if the common value is lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous rounds, bids for prizes in the lower value range have varied significantly, often with lower bids winning. With a perceived value of 34, I will bid 25. This bid strikes a balance between being competitive and leaving enough margin to potentially earn a profit even if the true common value is slightly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 12, 10.

Previous bids have shown that low bids like 5 and 18 can win, especially in lower value rounds. A bid of 10 allows me a chance to win if others bid similarly low amounts, while keeping my potential loss small in case I do not win.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 39 and the history of previous rounds, I aim to bid competitively but ensure I leave room for profit if I win. In previous rounds, high bids tend to occur when perceived values are high, averaging around 60-72. When values are lower or medium, we see a wider range of bids from 5-40. By bidding 28, I place myself moderately, hoping to win while maintaining a potential profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid aligns with the pattern observed in earlier rounds.'

In round 0, I noticed a close competition even with lower perceived values. Bidding 72 should position me competitively, aiming to win without overpaying, as higher bids would reduce my net profit.

For a lower perceived value of 25, a conservative bid is advisable to minimize losses. Given the independent redraws each round, I aim to stay competitive enough to have a chance at winning but avoid overpaying.

With a value of 38, bidding 30 positions me competitively, especially since recent rounds have shown higher bids when perceived values were greater.

This strategy helps to ensure I am not overpaying if I win, and it also accounts for other bidders potentially having higher values and/or bidding aggressively. Given the variability in adjustments and assuming a conservative approach, a bid of 18 strikes a good balance.'

Given the new drawn value of 80 for this round, I aim to balance maximizing my chances of winning while minimizing overpayment. A bid of 60 is significantly higher than previous highest bids, likely ensuring I win the prize, but it's also well below my perceived value ensuring a safety margin for profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, I observed that other bidders tend to bid aggressively when the value is relatively high. Given my current value of 23, I want to aim for a bid that balances both a chance of winning and cost minimization. Since bids tend to cluster relatively high when values are high (like 30s and above in earlier rounds), choosing a lower bid (e.g., 12) minimizes the risk of overpaying while still providing a reasonable shot at winning with a low perceived value.'

I've observed that the highest bids have usually been aggressive when values are perceived to be high. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while still keeping a substantial margin below my perceived value to ensure profitability if I win.

Based on previous rounds, competitive bids often fall within the high range when perceived values are high. However, for a low perceived value, bidding just slightly above zero provides a chance of winning only if others also have very low perceived values. A bid of 5 balances a low risk with a small opportunity to win the prize without overextending.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 and reflecting on the history of previous rounds, low perceived values usually result in conservative bidding. In rounds where perceived values were low, successful bids were close to the lower end of the bid range. A bid of 5 optimizes my chances of potentially winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This approach balances the likelihood of winning with the goal of maintaining total profit.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 10 and reflecting on the history of previous rounds, low perceived values usually result in conservative bidding. In rounds where perceived values were low, successful bids were close to the lower end of the bid range. A bid of 5 optimizes my chances of potentially winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This approach balances the likelihood of winning with the goal of maintaining total profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 33, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 29, 28, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 29. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 33 and reflecting on previous rounds where bids tend to be competitively placed around the mid to high range when values are higher, a bid of 22 provides a reasonable margin below my value. This strategy helps to balance the chance of winning with avoiding overpayment, ensuring a better likelihood of profit if successful.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 45, 44, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 45. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for this round, I've observed from previous rounds that bidding aggressively close to half of my perceived value provides a competitive stance while maintaining a reasonable safety margin to avoid overpaying. With bids often clustering in the mid to high range for moderate to high values, 40 strikes a balance between potentially securing the win and maximizing profit by ensuring I don't overpay.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 59, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 60, 55, 55, 52. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 67 for this round and learning from the history of previous rounds, I observe that high bids tend to hover around the low to mid-60s to 70s when values are perceived as relatively high. However, bidding in the high range often leads to lower or even negative profit margins. By bidding 55, I aim to be competitive while still preserving a substantial safety margin to avoid overpaying. This strategy seeks to balance the likelihood of winning with the goal of maximizing profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 3, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18, I need to consider previous rounds where values between 10 and 30 often saw winning bids in the lower to mid-range figures. Bidding 10 balances the chance of winning without overpaying, thus minimizing potential losses while maintaining competitiveness. This conservative approach aims to ensure I don't erode my total profit further.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 70 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 40, I want to bid an amount that allows for a good chance of winning without paying too much relative to the prize's value. Bidding 30 gives me a margin to profit if I win, assuming second highest bid will be near this amount.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 76, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 79, 75, 68, 60, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 79 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite high at 83, I want to bid competitively to maximize my chances of winning. From the previous round, the bids ranged from 18 to 30, so bidding 60 should be high enough to outbid others while still leaving room for profit even if the second-highest bid is somewhat lower.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 18, 18, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 24 in this round, aiming for a bid lower than my perceived value can minimize potential losses. The previous rounds have shown other bidders bidding fairly conservatively in some cases (with bids as low as 18), so bidding 15 might give me a chance to win without risking too much relative to my perceived value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 73, 72, 70, 70, 70. The highest bidder won with a bid of 73 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 88, I want to bid competitively but also leave room for profit. In previous rounds, bids reached as high as 79 and as low as 5. By bidding 70, I place myself in a strong position to win while hopefully paying less than my perceived value and maximizing profit.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 68, 65, 65, 52. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 75 this round, and observing the bid patterns from previous rounds, it seems that a bid in the 60-70 range is competitive. To maximize my chances of winning while still leaving room for profit, I decided to bid 65. This amount is above the midpoint of previous high bids but still lower than my perceived value, ensuring there's potential for a positive profit margin if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 75. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value towards the prize is 81, I want to bid competitively but also leave room for potential profit if I win. From the history of previous rounds, bids have generally ranged between 52 and 79 when the values are high. By bidding 67, I place myself in a strong position to possibly win the prize while keeping my bid lower than my perceived value, which allows for a better chance of making a profit based on the second highest bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 67, 60, 60, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 67. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 82 this round, and learning from the history of previous rounds where bids tend to be in the range of 60-79 for high values, I will bid 72. This bid is competitively high but still leaves room for profit if the second-highest bid is lower. It also aligns with the pattern of bids observed in prior rounds for similar perceived values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value for the prize is 28, I will bid conservatively to maximize my potential profit while ensuring that my loss, if any, is minimized. Previously, I have noticed that lower bids can sometimes win due to the variability in others' perceived values and bids, especially when overall values can range widely. A bid of 15 gives me an opportunity to possibly win at a lower payout if the common value is lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the previous rounds, bids for prizes in the lower value range have varied significantly, often with lower bids winning. With a perceived value of 34, I will bid 25. This bid strikes a balance between being competitive and leaving enough margin to potentially earn a profit even if the true common value is slightly lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 5, 18, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 15, I will bid conservatively to minimize potential loss and maximize profit. Previous bids have shown that low bids like 5 and 18 can win, especially in lower value rounds. A bid of 10 allows me a chance to win if others bid similarly low amounts, while keeping my potential loss small in case I do not win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 29, 28, 22, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 29. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value for the prize is 39 and the history of previous rounds, I aim to bid competitively but ensure I leave room for profit if I win. In previous rounds, high bids tend to occur when perceived values are high, averaging around 60-72. When values are lower or medium, we see a wider range of bids from 5-40. By bidding 28, I place myself moderately, hoping to win while maintaining a potential profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid aligns with the pattern observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 41, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 45, 44, 40, 35.

Reviewing previous rounds, bids often cluster around 30-40 when values are moderate. By bidding 35, I position myself strongly while leaving room for a profitable margin if I win and the second-highest bid is lower than my value.'

Previous rounds suggest that bids for higher values (around 72-83) typically range between 60 and 79. By bidding 60, I position myself to potentially win while keeping my bid comfortably below my perceived value, decreasing the risk and maximizing potential profit.'

In Round 1, I bid 40 for a perceived value of 58 and barely made a profit, as the second-highest bid was just 2 USD lower. Given the wide range of potential bids from other players, aiming for a bid slightly more than half of my value (15) should provide a balance between winning potential and securing a profit without risking overbidding and negating value.'

A bid of 70 should be competitive enough to win without excessively overbidding, leaving me room for a substantial profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

In the second round, the highest bid was 40, and the winner had a small profit. Considering that both values for the prize were higher overall, I'll moderate my bid to 25.

My value for the prize this round is 36. To balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value, hoping the second-highest bid will be substantially lower, thus maximizing my profit.

Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments. In this context, placing a bid of 12 is high enough to stay competitive without risking a large loss, considering the second-highest bids in previous rounds tended to be within the mid-range.'

In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit.

Given my value of 78, my strategy is to balance the likelihood of winning with the potential profit. To maximize my chances while accounting for previous bid patterns, I will bid 66, which is high enough to win against most other bids while still leaving a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 18, 17, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the observed bidding patterns in previous rounds, we know that bids tend to vary significantly. My value for the prize this round is 36. To balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value, hoping the second-highest bid will be substantially lower, thus maximizing my profit. Given this round's prize value, a bid of 29 strikes a good balance between competitiveness and profit margin.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17 for the prize, I need to balance between wanting to win the auction and trying to make a profit if I win. Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments. In this context, placing a bid of 12 is high enough to stay competitive without risking a large loss, considering the second-highest bids in previous rounds tended to be within the mid-range.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and considering the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, competitive bids that won often hovered around the mid to high end of the perceived value. For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 67 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

I will bid less than my value to ensure a higher potential for profit without risking a loss if I win with too high a bid and the second-highest bid is low. My bid of 10 represents a strategic middle ground.'

In Round 1, I bid 40 for a perceived value of 58 and barely made a profit, as the second-highest bid was just 2 USD lower. Given the wide range of potential bids from other players, aiming for a bid slightly more than half of my value (15) should provide a balance between winning potential and securing a profit without risking overbidding and negating value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 66, 65, 45, 41.

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high value for the prize in this round (95) and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, where the highest bids were around 40 for values in the range of 27 to 58, I want to bid aggressively to secure the high-value prize. A bid of 70 should be competitive enough to win without excessively overbidding, leaving me room for a substantial profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Reviewing previous rounds: when my value was similarly low (21 and 27), bids varied widely, but my conservative bids of 10 and 15 ensured I did not lose money even when I did not win. To maximize my profit potential while minimizing risk, I'll bid 10 this round\u2014low enough to avoid significant loss but potentially high enough to win if others also bid conservatively.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15, I need to be conservative in my approach to avoid incurring losses. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, I notice varying bids, but there is a pattern where lower bids can still win if others also bid conservatively. In round 4, my low bid of 10 did not win, whereas bids below 20 have won before. To balance potential winnings and risk, I opt to bid 7, which is slightly less than half my value, to ensure I avoid overbidding while maintaining a chance of winning.'

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 65, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning, but not so high that my profit margin is eroded. Historical rounds suggest a pattern where the second-highest bids tend to fall significantly below the highest. A bid of 47 should be competitive without excessively overbidding, aiming for a decent profit margin if I win upon considering the second-highest bid.'

While the values are independently redrawn each round, bidding just below my value helps ensure that if I win, I still earn a positive profit. There's also a chance that this bid won't be the highest, and thus I avoid overpaying. As it is early in the rounds without specific past data, a cautious approach is reasonable.'

To maximize my chances of winning and still ensuring a profit, I should bid high enough to just surpass likely competitive bids but not too high to risk a low-profit margin. Since previous bids varied and my perceived value is close to 36, bidding 34 strategically positions me within the upper bid range yet maintains a safe profit margin if the second-highest bid isn't too low.'

Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.'

Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.'

Looking at the history, second-highest bids have been around 20 to 38 in previous rounds. To maximize my chances of winning while accounting for the potential second-highest bid, I will aim for a bid that is likely to be the highest but still leave room for profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 58, I want to bid high enough to win the prize but not too high to ensure a profit. Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely. A bid of 40 is competitive and leaves a margin for profit even if someone bids slightly lower.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 1. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 25, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 27 and reviewing the history of past rounds, I've noted the following: In Round 0, I bid 10 for a perceived value of 21 and didn't win the prize. In Round 1, I bid 40 for a perceived value of 58 and barely made a profit, as the second-highest bid was just 2 USD lower. Given the wide range of potential bids from other players, aiming for a bid slightly more than half of my value (15) should provide a balance between winning potential and securing a profit without risking overbidding and negating value.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 66, 65, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high value for the prize in this round (95) and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, where the highest bids were around 40 for values in the range of 27 to 58, I want to bid aggressively to secure the high-value prize. A bid of 70 should be competitive enough to win without excessively overbidding, leaving me room for a substantial profit depending on the second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 24, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 18, 17, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 24, I need to weigh the potential for winning against the negative impact of overbidding. Reviewing previous rounds: when my value was similarly low (21 and 27), bids varied widely, but my conservative bids of 10 and 15 ensured I did not lose money even when I did not win. To maximize my profit potential while minimizing risk, I'll bid 10 this round\u2014low enough to avoid significant loss but potentially high enough to win if others also bid conservatively.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15, I need to be conservative in my approach to avoid incurring losses. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, I notice varying bids, but there is a pattern where lower bids can still win if others also bid conservatively. In round 4, my low bid of 10 did not win, whereas bids below 20 have won before. To balance potential winnings and risk, I opt to bid 7, which is slightly less than half my value, to ensure I avoid overbidding while maintaining a chance of winning.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 65, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning, but not so high that my profit margin is eroded. Historical rounds suggest a pattern where the second-highest bids tend to fall significantly below the highest. A bid of 47 should be competitive without excessively overbidding, aiming for a decent profit margin if I win upon considering the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I need to balance between ensuring a good chance of winning while not overbidding. Analyzing past rounds, bids have varied, but a bid less than my value usually avoids significant loss. Based on previous rounds, there's a pattern where the highest and second-highest bids tend to differ by around 5-10 units. A bid of 35 is competitive, high enough to potentially win, but not too high, allowing a safe margin for profit relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning while not overbidding too much to erode my profit margin. Analyzing past rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be relatively spread out, and the highest bids are often around 60-70 for high perceived values.

While the values are independently redrawn each round, bidding just below my value helps ensure that if I win, I still earn a positive profit. There's also a chance that this bid won't be the highest, and thus I avoid overpaying. As it is early in the rounds without specific past data, a cautious approach is reasonable.'

To maximize my chances of winning and still ensuring a profit, I should bid high enough to just surpass likely competitive bids but not too high to risk a low-profit margin. Since previous bids varied and my perceived value is close to 36, bidding 34 strategically positions me within the upper bid range yet maintains a safe profit margin if the second-highest bid isn't too low.'

From the history of previous bids, the highest bids have ranged from 28 to 40.

Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.'

Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments.

Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, competitive bids that won often hovered around the mid to high end of the perceived value. For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, competitive bids tend to result in higher chances of winning while staying profitable. In round 6, a winning bid of 60 had a second-highest bid of 52, illustrating the need to stay in this competitive range. Similarly, other rounds show second-highest bids often in the 50s for high-perceived values. A bid of 52 balances a good chance of winning without overly risking crossing the perceived value threshold, thus maximizing potential profit while staying competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for the prize, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. Analyzing previous rounds, we observe a trend where highly competitive bids often range around the mid to high 30s to low 40s when values were high. In round 3, with a value of 78, I bid 66 and the highest bid was 70, showing a high level of competition for valuable prizes. Similarly, other high-value bids also targeted a similar range of competitiveness. To stay competitive and maximize profit, my bid should be high enough to win against likely competitive bids yet leave a reasonable margin for profit. A bid of 41 fits this strategy, optimizing my chances while keeping potential profitability in mind.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 73 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Looking at the history, second-highest bids have been around 20 to 38 in previous rounds. To maximize my chances of winning while accounting for the potential second-highest bid, I will aim for a bid that is likely to be the highest but still leave room for profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is only 21, I want to be conservative in my bids to avoid losing money. I will bid less than my value to ensure a higher potential for profit without risking a loss if I win with too high a bid and the second-highest bid is low. My bid of 10 represents a strategic middle ground.'

Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely. A bid of 40 is competitive and leaves a margin for profit even if someone bids slightly lower.'

In Round 1, I bid 40 for a perceived value of 58 and barely made a profit, as the second-highest bid was just 2 USD lower. Given the wide range of potential bids from other players, aiming for a bid slightly more than half of my value (15) should provide a balance between winning potential and securing a profit without risking overbidding and negating value.'

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high value for the prize in this round (95) and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, where the highest bids were around 40 for values in the range of 27 to 58, I want to bid aggressively to secure the high-value prize. A bid of 70 should be competitive enough to win without excessively overbidding, leaving me room for a substantial profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Reviewing previous rounds: when my value was similarly low (21 and 27), bids varied widely, but my conservative bids of 10 and 15 ensured I did not lose money even when I did not win. To maximize my profit potential while minimizing risk, I'll bid 10 this round\u2014low enough to avoid significant loss but potentially high enough to win if others also bid conservatively.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15, I need to be conservative in my approach to avoid incurring losses. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, I notice varying bids, but there is a pattern where lower bids can still win if others also bid conservatively. In round 4, my low bid of 10 did not win, whereas bids below 20 have won before. To balance potential winnings and risk, I opt to bid 7, which is slightly less than half my value, to ensure I avoid overbidding while maintaining a chance of winning.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 65, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning, but not so high that my profit margin is eroded. Historical rounds suggest a pattern where the second-highest bids tend to fall significantly below the highest. A bid of 47 should be competitive without excessively overbidding, aiming for a decent profit margin if I win upon considering the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I need to balance between ensuring a good chance of winning while not overbidding. Analyzing past rounds, bids have varied, but a bid less than my value usually avoids significant loss. Based on previous rounds, there's a pattern where the highest and second-highest bids tend to differ by around 5-10 units. A bid of 35 is competitive, high enough to potentially win, but not too high, allowing a safe margin for profit relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning while not overbidding too much to erode my profit margin. Analyzing past rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be relatively spread out, and the highest bids are often around 60-70 for high perceived values. By bidding 52, I ensure a strong chance of winning without risking excessive overpayment, taking into consideration the potential second-highest bid from other players.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I need to balance between bidding high enough to secure a good chance of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. From previous rounds, particularly rounds where I had similar values and bids (e.g., rounds 6 and 8), the highest bids tended to be within the range of 50-70 when the perceived values were high. However, I've also noted that aggressive bids sometimes resulted in zero profit or minimal profit margins.

While the values are independently redrawn each round, bidding just below my value helps ensure that if I win, I still earn a positive profit. There's also a chance that this bid won't be the highest, and thus I avoid overpaying. As it is early in the rounds without specific past data, a cautious approach is reasonable.'

Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for the prize, I need to balance between winning the auction and making a profit. Since winning requires me to pay the second-highest bid, my strategy is to bid a bit lower, assuming that if I do win, my payment will be close but below my value. By bidding 12, I aim to keep my potential loss limited while maintaining a reasonable chance to win.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 38, 32, 30, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 56 for the prize, I aim to bid strategically to balance winning the prize and maximizing profit. Observing the previous round, where the highest bid was significantly higher than others, I'll bid 38 to increase my chances of winning while keeping a substantial profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid will be notably lower.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 25, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the first round, the highest bid was 20, and the winner's profit was negative. In the second round, the highest bid was 40, and the winner had a small profit. Considering that both values for the prize were higher overall, I'll moderate my bid to 25. This increases my chances of being competitive while ensuring that the potential payment (the second-highest bid) doesn't exceed my perceived value (37). Therefore, bidding lower helps balance my goal of winning and securing profits.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 78, you bid 66, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 66, 65, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the previous rounds, the bids for the prize showed various levels of competitiveness. Given my value of 78, my strategy is to balance the likelihood of winning with the potential profit. To maximize my chances while accounting for previous bid patterns, I will bid 66, which is high enough to win against most other bids while still leaving a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 29, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -2.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 18, 17, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the observed bidding patterns in previous rounds, we know that bids tend to vary significantly. My value for the prize this round is 36. To balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value, hoping the second-highest bid will be substantially lower, thus maximizing my profit. Given this round's prize value, a bid of 29 strikes a good balance between competitiveness and profit margin.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17 for the prize, I need to balance between wanting to win the auction and trying to make a profit if I win. Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments. In this context, placing a bid of 12 is high enough to stay competitive without risking a large loss, considering the second-highest bids in previous rounds tended to be within the mid-range.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and considering the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, competitive bids that won often hovered around the mid to high end of the perceived value. For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, competitive bids tend to result in higher chances of winning while staying profitable. In round 6, a winning bid of 60 had a second-highest bid of 52, illustrating the need to stay in this competitive range. Similarly, other rounds show second-highest bids often in the 50s for high-perceived values. A bid of 52 balances a good chance of winning without overly risking crossing the perceived value threshold, thus maximizing potential profit while staying competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for the prize, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. Analyzing previous rounds, we observe a trend where highly competitive bids often range around the mid to high 30s to low 40s when values were high. In round 3, with a value of 78, I bid 66 and the highest bid was 70, showing a high level of competition for valuable prizes. Similarly, other high-value bids also targeted a similar range of competitiveness. To stay competitive and maximize profit, my bid should be high enough to win against likely competitive bids yet leave a reasonable margin for profit. A bid of 41 fits this strategy, optimizing my chances while keeping potential profitability in mind.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for the prize and reviewing the history of previous rounds, competitive bids often land around the mid-to-high end of perceived values. For instance, in rounds where my value for the prize was high, I often bid in the 50-60 range. These bids generally matched well with the highly competitive nature of previous results (e.g., round 6 with a value of 67 had bids reaching 60). Hence, to balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, I will bid 58.

While this strategy did not yield any profit in the previous rounds, it remains reasonable considering the competitive nature of the bids and high variability in other bidders\u2019 values and bids. By bidding 17, I aim to stay competitive while minimizing potential losses if I win the prize and pay the second-highest bid.'

While bidding half the value has not yet yielded a profit, it remains a reasonable approach to balance the risk of winning with a high bid and the potential reward. For this round, my perceived value is 12, so I will bid 6.'

From previous rounds, particularly rounds where I had similar values and bids (e.g., rounds 6 and 8), the highest bids tended to be within the range of 50-70 when the perceived values were high. However, I've also noted that aggressive bids sometimes resulted in zero profit or minimal profit margins.

In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, we've seen other bidders tend to bid close to their perceived values. Given my value of 29 for this round and considering the past second-highest bids in the range of 18-66, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value. This strategy aims to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a positive profit margin if I end up winning, though not overpaying considerably. A bid of 24 is a balanced approach between competitive positioning and risk management based on historical bids.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for the prize this round and analyzing previous rounds' bidding patterns, I notice that the highest bids often range widely but can get quite competitive in higher value rounds. A bid of 60 slightly undercuts my perceived value yet remains competitive enough to secure the prize potentially. This bid aims to balance maximizing my total profit by keeping the second-highest bid closer to ensure a positive profit while not overbidding dramatically.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical bids, previous rounds show that bids can range quite widely with high variability. Given my value towards the prize is 45 this round, I aim to bid just below my perceived value to maximize the chances of winning without overly risking a significant loss. Bidding 38 provides a competitive yet cautious approach, factoring in the variation in other bidders' behaviors to potentially secure the prize while maintaining a positive profit margin. ' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 60 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I notice that the highest bids often range widely but tend to hover around or slightly below the perceived values. A bid of 45 is competitive enough to give me a strong chance of winning while also leaving room for a decent profit margin. This bid aims to balance winning the prize with minimizing the risk of overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing my previous rounds, other bidders' behaviors show a decrease in their bid values when the common value is moderate to low. Considering my current value of 36, I will bid 30 to balance the potential risk and reward. This strategy aims to increase my chances of winning while avoiding significant losses if the second-highest bid is vastly lower. Historically, maintaining bids below the perceived value has avoided substantial overbidding.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 74, I need to strike a balance between bidding high enough to secure the prize and low enough to ensure a profit if I win. Previous rounds show a range of bids and the importance of avoiding overpaying. Analyzing bids where the perceived value was around 70-90, other high bids were competitive but not excessive compared to their values. To maximize profit and remain competitive, I will bid 61. This takes into account potential second-highest bids being in the range of 50-60 based on previous data, thus positioning me well to win without risking significant loss.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 77 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Observing the previous round, where the highest bid was significantly higher than others, I'll bid 38 to increase my chances of winning while keeping a substantial profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid will be notably lower.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 37, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 25, 18, 15, 10.

In the second round, the highest bid was 40, and the winner had a small profit. Considering that both values for the prize were higher overall, I'll moderate my bid to 25. This increases my chances of being competitive while ensuring that the potential payment (the second-highest bid) doesn't exceed my perceived value (37). Therefore, bidding lower helps balance my goal of winning and securing profits.'

My value for the prize this round is 36. To balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value, hoping the second-highest bid will be substantially lower, thus maximizing my profit. Given this round's prize value, a bid of 29 strikes a good balance between competitiveness and profit margin.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17 for the prize, I need to balance between wanting to win the auction and trying to make a profit if I win. Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments. In this context, placing a bid of 12 is high enough to stay competitive without risking a large loss, considering the second-highest bids in previous rounds tended to be within the mid-range.'

In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.'

For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, competitive bids tend to result in higher chances of winning while staying profitable. In round 6, a winning bid of 60 had a second-highest bid of 52, illustrating the need to stay in this competitive range. Similarly, other rounds show second-highest bids often in the 50s for high-perceived values. A bid of 52 balances a good chance of winning without overly risking crossing the perceived value threshold, thus maximizing potential profit while staying competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for the prize, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. Analyzing previous rounds, we observe a trend where highly competitive bids often range around the mid to high 30s to low 40s when values were high. In round 3, with a value of 78, I bid 66 and the highest bid was 70, showing a high level of competition for valuable prizes. Similarly, other high-value bids also targeted a similar range of competitiveness. To stay competitive and maximize profit, my bid should be high enough to win against likely competitive bids yet leave a reasonable margin for profit. A bid of 41 fits this strategy, optimizing my chances while keeping potential profitability in mind.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for the prize and reviewing the history of previous rounds, competitive bids often land around the mid-to-high end of perceived values. For instance, in rounds where my value for the prize was high, I often bid in the 50-60 range. These bids generally matched well with the highly competitive nature of previous results (e.g., round 6 with a value of 67 had bids reaching 60). Hence, to balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, I will bid 58. This should be high enough to stay competitive while aiming for a good profit margin if I win.'

Analyzing previous rounds, we see that highly competitive bids for high perceived values generally range in the 55-65 area. For instance, in round 10, with my perceived value of 73, the highest bid was 70, indicating strong competition.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds, my strategy is to bid conservatively. The values and bids are redrawn independently each round, and previous successful bids often show significant variability. Since my current value is relatively low, I aim to avoid overbidding and potentially incurring a loss. Bidding 10 balances the chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 63, I want to bid aggressively but avoid overpaying. Looking at the history, winning bids have ranged from 6 to 70, with second-highest bids often falling between 10 and 38. To maximize my chance of winning while keeping a reasonable profit margin, I will bid 52, ensuring I have a strong position without excessive risk.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 40 for this round, I aim to secure a good balance between a winning bid and maintaining a profit margin. From the history of previous rounds, second-highest bids have varied widely but often fall within a range that would make a bid of 30 competitive while not overpaying significantly if I win. This strategy allows for a potential net gain, especially considering my total value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for this round and analyzing the historical bids where second-highest bids tend to fall within 10 to 38 range, I will bid 50. This bid is aggressive enough to maximize my chances of winning while leaving enough margin to profit, considering a common value in this range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for this round, I should aim for a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a good profit margin. Analyzing the history, bids lower than my value have occasionally won, and the second-highest bids have often fallen into a range within 18-38. By bidding 24, I position myself competitively without overpaying, allowing for the possibility of a moderate profit if I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I want to bid aggressively to maximize my chance of winning while still ensuring a profit margin. Looking at the history, winning bids have been as high as 70, and second-highest bids have often been around the range of 60 to 70. A bid of 70 positions me favorably, as it is likely to be competitive and should secure a positive profit when subtracting the second-highest bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 7.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35.

A bid of 47 should be competitive without excessively overbidding, aiming for a decent profit margin if I win upon considering the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I need to balance between ensuring a good chance of winning while not overbidding. Analyzing past rounds, bids have varied, but a bid less than my value usually avoids significant loss. Based on previous rounds, there's a pattern where the highest and second-highest bids tend to differ by around 5-10 units. A bid of 35 is competitive, high enough to potentially win, but not too high, allowing a safe margin for profit relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning while not overbidding too much to erode my profit margin. Analyzing past rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be relatively spread out, and the highest bids are often around 60-70 for high perceived values. By bidding 52, I ensure a strong chance of winning without risking excessive overpayment, taking into consideration the potential second-highest bid from other players.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I need to balance between bidding high enough to secure a good chance of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. From previous rounds, particularly rounds where I had similar values and bids (e.g., rounds 6 and 8), the highest bids tended to be within the range of 50-70 when the perceived values were high. However, I've also noted that aggressive bids sometimes resulted in zero profit or minimal profit margins. Thus, bidding 38 should be competitive enough to have a decent chance of winning while leaving room for potential profit based on the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 63, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 86, I want to strike a balance between a high probability of winning and ensuring a profit. From previous rounds, the second-highest bids have varied but tend to be considerably lower than the highest ones. By bidding 63, I am aggressive enough to have a strong chance of winning, while leaving a significant margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is lower, as it generally has been in previous rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 86 and analyzing previous rounds, it is evident that aggressive bids around 60-70 have had a good chance at winning. Considering the highest bid tends to vary significantly and given the competitive nature of bids, aiming slightly lower than my previous bid of 63 but still aggressive should give a good chance at winning while ensuring a significant profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 68 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

While the values are independently redrawn each round, bidding just below my value helps ensure that if I win, I still earn a positive profit. There's also a chance that this bid won't be the highest, and thus I avoid overpaying. As it is early in the rounds without specific past data, a cautious approach is reasonable.'

A bid of 32 gives me a reasonable chance of winning while still aiming for a positive profit margin in case of winning, considering that the second-highest bid might still be relatively low.'

For the second round, bids ranged from 28 to 40. Now, my value is 36 for this round. To maximize my chances of winning and still ensuring a profit, I should bid high enough to just surpass likely competitive bids but not too high to risk a low-profit margin. Since previous bids varied and my perceived value is close to 36, bidding 34 strategically positions me within the upper bid range yet maintains a safe profit margin if the second-highest bid isn't too low.'

Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.'

Given my value of 29 for this round and considering the past second-highest bids in the range of 18-66, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value. This strategy aims to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a positive profit margin if I end up winning, though not overpaying considerably.

A bid of 60 slightly undercuts my perceived value yet remains competitive enough to secure the prize potentially. This bid aims to balance maximizing my total profit by keeping the second-highest bid closer to ensure a positive profit while not overbidding dramatically.'

Considering my current value of 36, I will bid 30 to balance the potential risk and reward. This strategy aims to increase my chances of winning while avoiding significant losses if the second-highest bid is vastly lower. Historically, maintaining bids below the perceived value has avoided substantial overbidding.'

Previous rounds show a range of bids and the importance of avoiding overpaying. Analyzing bids where the perceived value was around 70-90, other high bids were competitive but not excessive compared to their values. To maximize profit and remain competitive, I will bid 61. This takes into account potential second-highest bids being in the range of 50-60 based on previous data, thus positioning me well to win without risking significant loss.'

By reviewing previous rounds, it\u2019s clear that bids often vary substantially, particularly when perceived values are higher. Notably, bids tend to cluster around the perceived values, but generally are slightly below. Since I anticipate the second-highest bid could be around the low 60s based on past behaviors, bidding 62 positions me well for a favorable outcome.

In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 34, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the previous rounds, competitive bids that won often hovered around the mid to high end of the perceived value. For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, competitive bids tend to result in higher chances of winning while staying profitable. In round 6, a winning bid of 60 had a second-highest bid of 52, illustrating the need to stay in this competitive range. Similarly, other rounds show second-highest bids often in the 50s for high-perceived values. A bid of 52 balances a good chance of winning without overly risking crossing the perceived value threshold, thus maximizing potential profit while staying competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for the prize, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. Analyzing previous rounds, we observe a trend where highly competitive bids often range around the mid to high 30s to low 40s when values were high. In round 3, with a value of 78, I bid 66 and the highest bid was 70, showing a high level of competition for valuable prizes. Similarly, other high-value bids also targeted a similar range of competitiveness. To stay competitive and maximize profit, my bid should be high enough to win against likely competitive bids yet leave a reasonable margin for profit. A bid of 41 fits this strategy, optimizing my chances while keeping potential profitability in mind.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 73 for the prize and reviewing the history of previous rounds, competitive bids often land around the mid-to-high end of perceived values. For instance, in rounds where my value for the prize was high, I often bid in the 50-60 range. These bids generally matched well with the highly competitive nature of previous results (e.g., round 6 with a value of 67 had bids reaching 60). Hence, to balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, I will bid 58. This should be high enough to stay competitive while aiming for a good profit margin if I win.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 71 for the prize this round, I need to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Analyzing previous rounds, we see that highly competitive bids for high perceived values generally range in the 55-65 area. For instance, in round 10, with my perceived value of 73, the highest bid was 70, indicating strong competition. However, my bid should aim to maximize the margin for profit without exceeding likely competitors. Hence, I will bid 55 to stay competitive while optimizing potential profit.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70, 51, 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize and analyzing the previous rounds, I notice that competitive bids for high-perceived values tend to range from the mid-50s to low-60s. For instance, in rounds where values were high (e.g., round 10 with a value of 73 had bids reaching up to 70), bids above 50 but below 60 were common. To balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, a bid of 51 strikes a good balance. It's high enough to be competitive while leaving a margin for profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls within a range typical for these values.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Andy. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 16 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

From previous rounds, particularly rounds where I had similar values and bids (e.g., rounds 6 and 8), the highest bids tended to be within the range of 50-70 when the perceived values were high. However, I've also noted that aggressive bids sometimes resulted in zero profit or minimal profit margins. Thus, bidding 38 should be competitive enough to have a decent chance of winning while leaving room for potential profit based on the second-highest bid.'

A bid of 45 is slightly higher than the previous highest bid of 40; this strikes a balance between maximizing my chances of winning and not overpaying too much, securing a positive profit margin given that the second-highest bid is likely to be lower than 45.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -10. \\nAll the bids for this round were 29, 18, 17, 10, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the information from prior rounds, other bidders tend to bid relatively high, often close to their perceived values. Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In previous rounds, we've seen other bidders tend to bid close to their perceived values. Given my value of 29 for this round and considering the past second-highest bids in the range of 18-66, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value. This strategy aims to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring a positive profit margin if I end up winning, though not overpaying considerably. A bid of 24 is a balanced approach between competitive positioning and risk management based on historical bids.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 3.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for the prize this round and analyzing previous rounds' bidding patterns, I notice that the highest bids often range widely but can get quite competitive in higher value rounds. A bid of 60 slightly undercuts my perceived value yet remains competitive enough to secure the prize potentially. This bid aims to balance maximizing my total profit by keeping the second-highest bid closer to ensure a positive profit while not overbidding dramatically.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering the historical bids, previous rounds show that bids can range quite widely with high variability. Given my value towards the prize is 45 this round, I aim to bid just below my perceived value to maximize the chances of winning without overly risking a significant loss. Bidding 38 provides a competitive yet cautious approach, factoring in the variation in other bidders' behaviors to potentially secure the prize while maintaining a positive profit margin. ' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 60 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, I notice that the highest bids often range widely but tend to hover around or slightly below the perceived values. A bid of 45 is competitive enough to give me a strong chance of winning while also leaving room for a decent profit margin. This bid aims to balance winning the prize with minimizing the risk of overpaying compared to the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing my previous rounds, other bidders' behaviors show a decrease in their bid values when the common value is moderate to low. Considering my current value of 36, I will bid 30 to balance the potential risk and reward. This strategy aims to increase my chances of winning while avoiding significant losses if the second-highest bid is vastly lower. Historically, maintaining bids below the perceived value has avoided substantial overbidding.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 74, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 74, I need to strike a balance between bidding high enough to secure the prize and low enough to ensure a profit if I win. Previous rounds show a range of bids and the importance of avoiding overpaying. Analyzing bids where the perceived value was around 70-90, other high bids were competitive but not excessive compared to their values. To maximize profit and remain competitive, I will bid 61. This takes into account potential second-highest bids being in the range of 50-60 based on previous data, thus positioning me well to win without risking significant loss.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize this round is 77, I want to place a bid that's competitive but still allows for a potential profit margin. By reviewing previous rounds, it\u2019s clear that bids often vary substantially, particularly when perceived values are higher. Notably, bids tend to cluster around the perceived values, but generally are slightly below. Since I anticipate the second-highest bid could be around the low 60s based on past behaviors, bidding 62 positions me well for a favorable outcome. This way, I maximize my chances of winning while keeping a buffer to maintain a positive profit margin.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70, 51, 50, 42.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, other bidders tend to bid relatively high, especially when the values are high. Bids over the past rounds reflect that second-highest bids can range widely but often hover between 60-70 when common values are perceived high. By bidding 70, I balance the strategy of being competitive enough to potentially win while aiming to achieve a positive profit margin by not overbidding dramatically.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 27 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for the prize, I need to balance between winning the auction and making a profit. Since winning requires me to pay the second-highest bid, my strategy is to bid a bit lower, assuming that if I do win, my payment will be close but below my value.

Observing the previous round, where the highest bid was significantly higher than others, I'll bid 38 to increase my chances of winning while keeping a substantial profit margin, assuming the second-highest bid will be notably lower.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In the first round, the highest bid was 20, and the winner's profit was negative. In the second round, the highest bid was 40, and the winner had a small profit. Considering that both values for the prize were higher overall, I'll moderate my bid to 25. This increases my chances of being competitive while ensuring that the potential payment (the second-highest bid) doesn't exceed my perceived value (37). Therefore, bidding lower helps balance my goal of winning and securing profits.'

My value for the prize this round is 36. To balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit, I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value, hoping the second-highest bid will be substantially lower, thus maximizing my profit.

Based on the history, it appears that moderate bids tend to be more optimal to avoid significant losses or overpayments. In this context, placing a bid of 12 is high enough to stay competitive without risking a large loss, considering the second-highest bids in previous rounds tended to be within the mid-range.'

In round 3, when my value was high (78), the highest bid was 70 and the second-highest was 66. Similarly, competitive bids were seen in other rounds as well. Therefore, I aim to place a competitive bid that's high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a substantial margin of profit. A bid of 50 achieves this balance, considering I may need to outbid values in the mid-to-high range while keeping a positive profit.'

For my value of 46, a bid lower than my perceived value, say around 34, would position me competitively while aiming to balance the likelihood of winning with potential profitability. Winning bids in earlier rounds often had second-highest bids not too far off, so this strategy allows some margin.'

In round 6, a winning bid of 60 had a second-highest bid of 52, illustrating the need to stay in this competitive range. Similarly, other rounds show second-highest bids often in the 50s for high-perceived values. A bid of 52 balances a good chance of winning without overly risking crossing the perceived value threshold, thus maximizing potential profit while staying competitive.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for the prize, I need to balance the likelihood of winning against the potential profit. Analyzing previous rounds, we observe a trend where highly competitive bids often range around the mid to high 30s to low 40s when values were high. In round 3, with a value of 78, I bid 66 and the highest bid was 70, showing a high level of competition for valuable prizes. Similarly, other high-value bids also targeted a similar range of competitiveness. To stay competitive and maximize profit, my bid should be high enough to win against likely competitive bids yet leave a reasonable margin for profit. A bid of 41 fits this strategy, optimizing my chances while keeping potential profitability in mind.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 73, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40.

For instance, in rounds where my value for the prize was high, I often bid in the 50-60 range. These bids generally matched well with the highly competitive nature of previous results (e.g., round 6 with a value of 67 had bids reaching 60). Hence, to balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, I will bid 58. This should be high enough to stay competitive while aiming for a good profit margin if I win.'

Analyzing previous rounds, we see that highly competitive bids for high perceived values generally range in the 55-65 area. For instance, in round 10, with my perceived value of 73, the highest bid was 70, indicating strong competition. However, my bid should aim to maximize the margin for profit without exceeding likely competitors. Hence, I will bid 55 to stay competitive while optimizing potential profit.'

To balance the likelihood of winning and potential profitability, a bid of 51 strikes a good balance. It's high enough to be competitive while leaving a margin for profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls within a range typical for these values.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 17, my goal is to ensure I have a chance to win while not overpaying. Based on previous rounds and the redrawing of independent values and private adjustments, a bid of 10 positions me to potentially outbid others while maintaining a margin to still make a profit if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 44 for this round, I want to bid aggressively but also avoid overpaying. From previous rounds, the winning bids ranged around 7 to 20. Therefore, bidding 30 positions me to likely win while still leaving room for profit, given that my perceived value is significantly higher than these previous bids observed.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 18, the (true) common value of the prize was 19, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 25, 18, 15, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 28 for this round and the historical context where winning bids and second-highest bids have exceeded my value when bidding aggressively, I aim to balance the chance of securing the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Therefore, I will bid 18, which is a bit lower compared to the values from previous rounds but could still be competitive while protecting my profit margin.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 77, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 66, 65, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 79 for this round, I want to bid aggressively since it's the highest possible perceived value. Looking at the history, second-highest bids have been around 20 to 38 in previous rounds. To maximize my chances of winning while accounting for the potential second-highest bid, I will aim for a bid that is likely to be the highest but still leave room for profit. A bid of 65 positions me to very likely win and leaves a profit margin assuming the second-highest bid will be lower.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 29 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18 for this round and observing the history of bids, I need to ensure a balance between winning the prize and not overpaying. Previous rounds have shown that bids can vary widely, but with my current lower value, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid a net loss. A bid of 10 gives me a moderate chance of winning without risking too much of my potential profit.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 6, 24, 12, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 6. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 21 for this round and considering the history of previous rounds, my strategy is to bid conservatively. The values and bids are redrawn independently each round, and previous successful bids often show significant variability. Since my current value is relatively low, I aim to avoid overbidding and potentially incurring a loss. Bidding 10 balances the chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value is 63, I want to bid aggressively but avoid overpaying. Looking at the history, winning bids have ranged from 6 to 70, with second-highest bids often falling between 10 and 38. To maximize my chance of winning while keeping a reasonable profit margin, I will bid 52, ensuring I have a strong position without excessive risk.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 40 for this round, I aim to secure a good balance between a winning bid and maintaining a profit margin. From the history of previous rounds, second-highest bids have varied widely but often fall within a range that would make a bid of 30 competitive while not overpaying significantly if I win. This strategy allows for a potential net gain, especially considering my total value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for this round and analyzing the historical bids where second-highest bids tend to fall within 10 to 38 range, I will bid 50. This bid is aggressive enough to maximize my chances of winning while leaving enough margin to profit, considering a common value in this range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for this round, I should aim for a balance between winning the prize and maintaining a good profit margin. Analyzing the history, bids lower than my value have occasionally won, and the second-highest bids have often fallen into a range within 18-38. By bidding 24, I position myself competitively without overpaying, allowing for the possibility of a moderate profit if I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 4.\\nYour total profit is 4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 63. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I want to bid aggressively to maximize my chance of winning while still ensuring a profit margin. Looking at the history, winning bids have been as high as 70, and second-highest bids have often been around the range of 60 to 70. A bid of 70 positions me favorably, as it is likely to be competitive and should secure a positive profit when subtracting the second-highest bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 85, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 7.\\nYour total profit is 11. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is only 21, I want to be conservative in my bids to avoid losing money. I will bid less than my value to ensure a higher potential for profit without risking a loss if I win with too high a bid and the second-highest bid is low. My bid of 10 represents a strategic middle ground.'

The winner's profit was 1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 58, I want to bid high enough to win the prize but not too high to ensure a profit. Based on previous rounds, bids have varied widely. A bid of 40 is competitive and leaves a margin for profit even if someone bids slightly lower.'

In Round 1, I bid 40 for a perceived value of 58 and barely made a profit, as the second-highest bid was just 2 USD lower. Given the wide range of potential bids from other players, aiming for a bid slightly more than half of my value (15) should provide a balance between winning potential and securing a profit without risking overbidding and negating value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 66. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high value for the prize in this round (95) and analyzing the bids from previous rounds, where the highest bids were around 40 for values in the range of 27 to 58, I want to bid aggressively to secure the high-value prize. A bid of 70 should be competitive enough to win without excessively overbidding, leaving me room for a substantial profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Reviewing previous rounds: when my value was similarly low (21 and 27), bids varied widely, but my conservative bids of 10 and 15 ensured I did not lose money even when I did not win. To maximize my profit potential while minimizing risk, I'll bid 10 this round\u2014low enough to avoid significant loss but potentially high enough to win if others also bid conservatively.'

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 15, I need to be conservative in my approach to avoid incurring losses. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, I notice varying bids, but there is a pattern where lower bids can still win if others also bid conservatively. In round 4, my low bid of 10 did not win, whereas bids below 20 have won before. To balance potential winnings and risk, I opt to bid 7, which is slightly less than half my value, to ensure I avoid overbidding while maintaining a chance of winning.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 52, 50, 47, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 65, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning, but not so high that my profit margin is eroded. Historical rounds suggest a pattern where the second-highest bids tend to fall significantly below the highest. A bid of 47 should be competitive without excessively overbidding, aiming for a decent profit margin if I win upon considering the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 38, 35, 34, 30, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 38 and paid 35. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 49, I need to balance between ensuring a good chance of winning while not overbidding. Analyzing past rounds, bids have varied, but a bid less than my value usually avoids significant loss. Based on previous rounds, there's a pattern where the highest and second-highest bids tend to differ by around 5-10 units. A bid of 35 is competitive, high enough to potentially win, but not too high, allowing a safe margin for profit relative to my perceived value.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 52, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 52, 50, 45, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 72, I want to bid high enough to maximize my chances of winning while not overbidding too much to erode my profit margin. Analyzing past rounds, I've observed that bids tend to be relatively spread out, and the highest bids are often around 60-70 for high perceived values. By bidding 52, I ensure a strong chance of winning without risking excessive overpayment, taking into consideration the potential second-highest bid from other players.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 38, 30, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I need to balance between bidding high enough to secure a good chance of winning while ensuring a reasonable profit margin. From previous rounds, particularly rounds where I had similar values and bids (e.g., rounds 6 and 8), the highest bids tended to be within the range of 50-70 when the perceived values were high. However, I've also noted that aggressive bids sometimes resulted in zero profit or minimal profit margins. Thus, bidding 38 should be competitive enough to have a decent chance of winning while leaving room for potential profit based on the second-highest bid.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 63, the (true) common value of the prize was 67, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 63, 61, 58, 40.

From previous rounds, the second-highest bids have varied but tend to be considerably lower than the highest ones. By bidding 63, I am aggressive enough to have a strong chance of winning, while leaving a significant margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is lower, as it generally has been in previous rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 62, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 62, 62, 55, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 86 and analyzing previous rounds, it is evident that aggressive bids around 60-70 have had a good chance at winning. Considering the highest bid tends to vary significantly and given the competitive nature of bids, aiming slightly lower than my previous bid of 63 but still aggressive should give a good chance at winning while ensuring a significant profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70, 51, 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 68, and learning from the history of previous rounds, a bid around 50 should strike a reasonable balance between securing a win and ensuring a profit. In earlier rounds with similar perceived values, aggressive yet not excessively high bids (around 50-70) have shown a good potential for securing the prize while leaving a profit margin. A bid of 50 is competitive enough to have a strong chance of winning, considering past second-highest bids have often been lower, thus maintaining a good potential for profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 14, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I need to be cautious to avoid a negative profit. In previous rounds where my value was similarly low (e.g., rounds 0, 2, 4), bids around half or slightly below half of my value have been conservative yet competitive. A bid of 15 balances the risk of overbidding while maintaining a chance of winning, considering the varied nature of other bidders' values and bids.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 37 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

While the values are independently redrawn each round, bidding just below my value helps ensure that if I win, I still earn a positive profit. There's also a chance that this bid won't be the highest, and thus I avoid overpaying. As it is early in the rounds without specific past data, a cautious approach is reasonable.'

For the second round, bids ranged from 28 to 40. Now, my value is 36 for this round. To maximize my chances of winning and still ensuring a profit, I should bid high enough to just surpass likely competitive bids but not too high to risk a low-profit margin. Since previous bids varied and my perceived value is close to 36, bidding 34 strategically positions me within the upper bid range yet maintains a safe profit margin if the second-highest bid isn't too low.'

Given my value of 26 for this round and aiming to avoid overbidding while still having a chance to win, I'll bid cautiously. Since most second-highest bids have been around 30-40, and the true values fluctuate, bidding 18 allows me to potentially win with a decent profit margin while mitigating risks of substantial losses if I end up paying the second-highest bid close to my own value.'

A bid of 60 slightly undercuts my perceived value yet remains competitive enough to secure the prize potentially. This bid aims to balance maximizing my total profit by keeping the second-highest bid closer to ensure a positive profit while not overbidding dramatically.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 38. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Analyzing my previous rounds, other bidders' behaviors show a decrease in their bid values when the common value is moderate to low. Considering my current value of 36, I will bid 30 to balance the potential risk and reward. This strategy aims to increase my chances of winning while avoiding significant losses if the second-highest bid is vastly lower. Historically, maintaining bids below the perceived value has avoided substantial overbidding.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 74, I need to strike a balance between bidding high enough to secure the prize and low enough to ensure a profit if I win. Previous rounds show a range of bids and the importance of avoiding overpaying. Analyzing bids where the perceived value was around 70-90, other high bids were competitive but not excessive compared to their values. To maximize profit and remain competitive, I will bid 61. This takes into account potential second-highest bids being in the range of 50-60 based on previous data, thus positioning me well to win without risking significant loss.'

By reviewing previous rounds, it\u2019s clear that bids often vary substantially, particularly when perceived values are higher. Notably, bids tend to cluster around the perceived values, but generally are slightly below. Since I anticipate the second-highest bid could be around the low 60s based on past behaviors, bidding 62 positions me well for a favorable outcome. This way, I maximize my chances of winning while keeping a buffer to maintain a positive profit margin.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 64, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 70, 51, 50, 42.

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, other bidders tend to bid relatively high, especially when the values are high. Bids over the past rounds reflect that second-highest bids can range widely but often hover between 60-70 when common values are perceived high. By bidding 70, I balance the strategy of being competitive enough to potentially win while aiming to achieve a positive profit margin by not overbidding dramatically.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 27, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 14, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -13. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 20, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 27 for the prize this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns, bidders often range their bids widely. While perceived values are independent each round, bids from the other bids are often competitive but not excessive compared to their estimated values. To maximize profit and avoid overpaying, I'll bid 20, which considers the likelihood of being competitive while leaving room for a profit margin, aiming for the second-highest bid to remain below my perceived value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 36 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Bidding too aggressively could lead to paying more than the value I perceive, thus making a loss.

The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and learning from previous rounds' results, aiming to submit a competitive yet profitable bid is essential. In past rounds, bids around the mid-to-high teens (14-22) were common among others, but often the highest bids vary significantly.

The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for this round's prize and reflecting on the bidding patterns from previous rounds, aiming to stay competitive with a substantial yet justified bid seems wise. In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51.

Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value.

In past rounds, bids around the mid-to-high teens (14-22) were common among others, but often the highest bids vary significantly.

In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51.

Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value. My intention is to make a bid that reflects my low perceived value without overcommitting, aiming to avoid bidding wars and potential losses. By bidding 5, I hope to remain competitive in the auction, considering my lower perceived prize value for this round.'

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 78, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 60, 60, 57, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 78 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for this round's prize and reflecting on the bidding patterns from previous rounds, aiming to stay competitive with a substantial yet justified bid seems wise. In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51. By bidding 60, I aim to secure the prize with a strong bid without vastly exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing the likelihood of profit while remaining cautious about the second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 8, 5, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round's prize is 9, I need to bid strategically to balance between winning the prize and making a profit. Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value. My intention is to make a bid that reflects my low perceived value without overcommitting, aiming to avoid bidding wars and potential losses. By bidding 5, I hope to remain competitive in the auction, considering my lower perceived prize value for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22 and learning from the previous rounds where my bids were typically higher and not always leading to significant profit, I recognize that winning the prize at a lower cost might yield better results. Keeping in mind that the second-highest bid in earlier rounds often varied, bidding 10 aims to strike a balance, ensuring I'm competitive while not risking a significant loss if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 11 for this round's prize and referencing prior rounds, bids have generally ranged widely with winning bids sometimes being significantly higher than the perceived value of the prizes. However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive. Therefore, by bidding 7, I aim to stay in the running without overcommmitting, given my relatively low perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for this round's prize, I want to balance staying competitive while ensuring a margin for profit. Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit.

By bidding slightly below my perceived value, I balance the risk of winning at a cost higher than the prize value against the chance of maximizing my profit. Historical data from previous rounds should also inform this decision, but in the absence of specific historical bids, a bid of 10 is a reasonable strategy.'

Given my perceived value of 46, I have a comfortable margin to place a higher bid than in the previous round. Bidding 32 allows me to potentially outbid others while maintaining a safety net to ensure that, if I win, I'll still make a profit considering the prize value. This bid is also based on the observation that people's bids range widely, and placing a competitive bid increases my chances of getting the prize.'

In previous rounds, we've seen that high bids can reach into the upper 30s.

Based on the history of previous rounds, bids can vary widely, with the highest bids ranging around 30s to 50s.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 11 for the prize and observing the pattern from previous rounds where bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high, I aim to bid conservatively. By bidding 10, I place myself in a competitive position while ensuring that if I win, the cost will not exceed my perceived value too much, thus maximizing potential profit if the second-highest bid isn't excessively high.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 for this round and considering past rounds where higher bids often exceed 30-40 when values are high, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. This ensures a balance between the chance of winning and not exceeding my perceived value too much, protecting from potential losses if the second-highest bid is close to my perceived value.'

Looking at the history, bids vary greatly, but typically the highest bid often does not exceed the 30-40 range unless the perceived value is very high.

In previous rounds, we've seen that bids often range widely, but high bids can reach up to around 60 for high perceived values. By bidding 55, I aim to position myself in a strong place to secure the prize without exceeding my perceived value too much, thereby maximizing my potential profit considering likely competition bids.'

However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive. Therefore, by bidding 7, I aim to stay in the running without overcommmitting, given my relatively low perceived value.'

Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit. Based on this history, a bid of 40 aims to secure the prize without overcommitting, considering my perceived higher value this round.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 12, I want to ensure I make a profit if I win the auction. By bidding slightly below my perceived value, I balance the risk of winning at a cost higher than the prize value against the chance of maximizing my profit. Historical data from previous rounds should also inform this decision, but in the absence of specific historical bids, a bid of 10 is a reasonable strategy.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 46, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 27, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 32, 18, 17, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In round 0, the highest bid was 22, suggesting that bids can reach significantly high values. Given my perceived value of 46, I have a comfortable margin to place a higher bid than in the previous round. Bidding 32 allows me to potentially outbid others while maintaining a safety net to ensure that, if I win, I'll still make a profit considering the prize value. This bid is also based on the observation that people's bids range widely, and placing a competitive bid increases my chances of getting the prize.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 51, 45, 39, 35, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 64, I want to secure a bid high enough to potentially win but still leave room for profit or mitigate losses. In previous rounds, we've seen that high bids can reach into the upper 30s. By bidding 45, I place myself as a strong competitor without exceeding what I believe is a reasonable margin where winning the bid would still allow some profit considering others' strategic moves.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 78 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 94 for this round, I aim to bid high enough to secure the prize but remain cautious to ensure profit. Based on the history of previous rounds, bids can vary widely, with the highest bids ranging around 30s to 50s. By bidding 60, I place myself in a strong position to win while leaving a margin for profit considering the potential second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 11 for the prize and observing the pattern from previous rounds where bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high, I aim to bid conservatively. By bidding 10, I place myself in a competitive position while ensuring that if I win, the cost will not exceed my perceived value too much, thus maximizing potential profit if the second-highest bid isn't excessively high.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 for this round and considering past rounds where higher bids often exceed 30-40 when values are high, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. This ensures a balance between the chance of winning and not exceeding my perceived value too much, protecting from potential losses if the second-highest bid is close to my perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 21 for this round, I need to ensure that I make a profit if I win. Looking at the history, bids vary greatly, but typically the highest bid often does not exceed the 30-40 range unless the perceived value is very high. By bidding 14, I position myself competitively while keeping the bid relatively conservative to maximize potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to or below my bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 72 and the bidding patterns observed in previous rounds, I need to place a bid that is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning while ensuring it is below my perceived value to maintain a profit if I win. In previous rounds, we've seen that bids often range widely, but high bids can reach up to around 60 for high perceived values. By bidding 55, I aim to position myself in a strong place to secure the prize without exceeding my perceived value too much, thereby maximizing my potential profit considering likely competition bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28.

By bidding 45, I position myself strongly to win while ensuring that my bid is below my perceived value to maximize potential profit, taking into account that I only pay the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize of 86 and analyzing the bidding patterns from previous rounds, high bids can range widely but sometimes go into the upper 50s or low 60s. To have a competitive chance of winning while ensuring I maximize potential profit, I will bid 65.

My intention is to make a bid that reflects my low perceived value without overcommitting, aiming to avoid bidding wars and potential losses. By bidding 5, I hope to remain competitive in the auction, considering my lower perceived prize value for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22 and learning from the previous rounds where my bids were typically higher and not always leading to significant profit, I recognize that winning the prize at a lower cost might yield better results. Keeping in mind that the second-highest bid in earlier rounds often varied, bidding 10 aims to strike a balance, ensuring I'm competitive while not risking a significant loss if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 11 for this round's prize and referencing prior rounds, bids have generally ranged widely with winning bids sometimes being significantly higher than the perceived value of the prizes. However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive. Therefore, by bidding 7, I aim to stay in the running without overcommmitting, given my relatively low perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for this round's prize, I want to balance staying competitive while ensuring a margin for profit. Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit. Based on this history, a bid of 40 aims to secure the prize without overcommitting, considering my perceived higher value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and the trends from previous rounds, bidding around 35-40 seems prudent. Bids higher than this often did not yield additional profit and resulted in higher payments based on the second-highest bid. By bidding 37, I attempt to stay competitive enough to win while keeping potential losses in check, aiming for maximizing profit if the second-highest bid remains reasonable.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high perceived value of 84 for this round's prize and looking at historical bids, a competitive and substantial bid is warranted. Previous high bids ranged between 57 and 78, with the winners often facing close amounts on second-highest bids. By bidding 70, I aim to outbid others without excessively overshooting, maximizing the chance of winning while still having a profitable margin.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 76 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Given my perceived value of 46, I have a comfortable margin to place a higher bid than in the previous round. Bidding 32 allows me to potentially outbid others while maintaining a safety net to ensure that, if I win, I'll still make a profit considering the prize value. This bid is also based on the observation that people's bids range widely, and placing a competitive bid increases my chances of getting the prize.'

In previous rounds, we've seen that bids often range widely, but high bids can reach up to around 60 for high perceived values. By bidding 55, I aim to position myself in a strong place to secure the prize without exceeding my perceived value too much, thereby maximizing my potential profit considering likely competition bids.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 22. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 29 for this round's prize, I want to maximize my chances of winning while still ensuring I am making a profit. Bidding too aggressively could lead to paying more than the value I perceive, thus making a loss. Having reviewed the outcomes of previous rounds, it seems a bid lower than my perceived value but still competitive has a better chance of yielding profit. Hence, I'm choosing 22.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 27, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 39, 32, 18, 17, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 39 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my previous experience, the highest bid was 22 and the winning bid was 7. My perceived value for the prize is 29, but I need to ensure I make a profit while being competitive. By bidding 14, I am keeping my bid lower, but still competitive to try and win the auction without overpaying.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 51, 45, 39, 35, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 51 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and learning from previous rounds' results, aiming to submit a competitive yet profitable bid is essential. In past rounds, bids around the mid-to-high teens (14-22) were common among others, but often the highest bids vary significantly. By bidding 35, I attempt to outbid the general range without risking an excessive payment beyond my perceived value, thus maximizing my chance of making a profit.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 78, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 60, 60, 57, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 78 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for this round's prize and reflecting on the bidding patterns from previous rounds, aiming to stay competitive with a substantial yet justified bid seems wise. In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51. By bidding 60, I aim to secure the prize with a strong bid without vastly exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing the likelihood of profit while remaining cautious about the second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 8, 5, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round's prize is 9, I need to bid strategically to balance between winning the prize and making a profit. Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value. My intention is to make a bid that reflects my low perceived value without overcommitting, aiming to avoid bidding wars and potential losses. By bidding 5, I hope to remain competitive in the auction, considering my lower perceived prize value for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22 and learning from the previous rounds where my bids were typically higher and not always leading to significant profit, I recognize that winning the prize at a lower cost might yield better results. Keeping in mind that the second-highest bid in earlier rounds often varied, bidding 10 aims to strike a balance, ensuring I'm competitive while not risking a significant loss if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 11 for this round's prize and referencing prior rounds, bids have generally ranged widely with winning bids sometimes being significantly higher than the perceived value of the prizes. However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive. Therefore, by bidding 7, I aim to stay in the running without overcommmitting, given my relatively low perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for this round's prize, I want to balance staying competitive while ensuring a margin for profit. Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit. Based on this history, a bid of 40 aims to secure the prize without overcommitting, considering my perceived higher value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and the trends from previous rounds, bidding around 35-40 seems prudent. Bids higher than this often did not yield additional profit and resulted in higher payments based on the second-highest bid. By bidding 37, I attempt to stay competitive enough to win while keeping potential losses in check, aiming for maximizing profit if the second-highest bid remains reasonable.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high perceived value of 84 for this round's prize and looking at historical bids, a competitive and substantial bid is warranted. Previous high bids ranged between 57 and 78, with the winners often facing close amounts on second-highest bids. By bidding 70, I aim to outbid others without excessively overshooting, maximizing the chance of winning while still having a profitable margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 83, 68, 65, 55, 46. The highest bidder won with a bid of 83 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for this round's prize and analyzing the historical bidding patterns, high bids often resulted in the highest profits when matched well with the second-highest bid. Previous winners with high values usually bid 57 to 78 and paid the second-highest bid, often around 55-57, which kept their net gains positive. By bidding 55, I aim to outbid others enough to capture the prize but also leave a reasonable margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is close.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 29 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit since I only pay the second-highest bid if I win. Bidding around half my value balances the risk and reward.'

In the previous rounds, the highest winning bids were 22 and 39. Thus, I aim to bid strategically high but slightly below my value to balance the risk of overpaying while maintaining a good chance of winning the prize. Bidding 39, which matched the highest winning bid from round 1, seems like a reasonable strategy to maximize my potential profit.'

To maximize my profit, I should bid conservatively, aiming to stay competitive without overpaying. A bid of 11 provides me a chance to win without taking excessive risk, given the historical variance in other bidders' strategies.'

In past rounds, bids around the mid-to-high teens (14-22) were common among others, but often the highest bids vary significantly.

In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51.

Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value.

However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive.

Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit.

Previous winners with high values usually bid 57 to 78 and paid the second-highest bid, often around 55-57, which kept their net gains positive. By bidding 55, I aim to outbid others enough to capture the prize but also leave a reasonable margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is close.'

In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 78, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 78, 60, 60, 57, 44. The highest bidder won with a bid of 78 and paid 60. The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 88, I want to place a competitive bid that captures the potential of having a high total value while also considering patterns from previous rounds. In those rounds, the highest bids ranged from 22 to 51. By bidding 44, I aim to strike a balance between increasing my chances of winning and making a profit, as it is likely to be below the winning threshold but still competitive.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 8, 5, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18 for this round, I aim to bid conservatively to maximize profit while still being competitive. In previous rounds, the winning bids have generally ranged between 22 and 78, while the second-highest bids varied less predictably. By bidding half my perceived value, I aim to strike a balance between having a chance to win with a low enough bid to avoid significant losses.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 9, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 19 for this round, and taking into account the results and bidding patterns from previous rounds, it seems strategic to bid conservatively. In round 4, with a value of 18, I bid 9, which was competitive but didn't win. Previous winning bids have awarded the highest bid with positive to negligible profit margins. By bidding 9 again, I aim to balance the realistic chance of winning with the goal to avoid overbidding and running at a loss, especially with such a low perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 11, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 22 for this round, I aim to bid conservatively to balance the potential for winning with the need to avoid significant losses. In previous rounds, bidding around half of my perceived value has been competitive yet cautious, which increases my chances of either securing the prize or minimizing my risk. By bidding 11, I hope to stay competitive while ensuring that potential losses remain manageable.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round, bidding close to half my value has been a general strategy to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overpayment. Bids in past rounds have shown that winning bids often align with roughly half of the perceived value, particularly when my perceived value is moderate. By bidding 28, I aim to maximize my chances of winning without overextending myself financially.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round, and reflecting on my previous bids and their outcomes, bidding close to half my perceived value has generally been a good strategy. This allows me to be competitive while not overextending financially. In round 7, with a perceived value of 57, I bid 28 which did not result in a win but was close to being competitive. Hence, I will stick to a similar approach and bid 28 again this round.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 82 for this round, I decided to bid close to half my perceived value, following the pattern I have set in previous rounds. Historical data shows that bidding around half the value allows me to be competitive without overextending financially. For example, in round 8, my bid of 28 with a value of 57 shows this approach. Hence, to maximize my chances of winning and making a profit, I will bid 41.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 93, you bid 46, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 83, 68, 65, 55, 46. The highest bidder won with a bid of 83 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 93 for this round, and analyzing the outcomes of previous rounds, I observe that bidding roughly half of my perceived value has been a consistent strategy. This approach attempts to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overbidding. Additionally, historical data indicates that the second-highest bids have often been moderately below the winning bids. By bidding 46, I aim to maximize my chances of winning while still allowing room for a profitable return.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 27, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 25, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round, I observe that bidding roughly half of my perceived value has been a consistent strategy. This approach balances the need to stay competitive while avoiding overbidding. Previous winning bids have also shown that staying in the middle range can be viable. For example, in rounds where my perceived value was above 50, bidding half resulted in competitive yet cautious bids.

The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 11 for the prize and observing the pattern from previous rounds where bids can vary widely but tend to be higher when perceived values are high, I aim to bid conservatively. By bidding 10, I place myself in a competitive position while ensuring that if I win, the cost will not exceed my perceived value too much, thus maximizing potential profit if the second-highest bid isn't excessively high.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -4.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 22 for this round and considering past rounds where higher bids often exceed 30-40 when values are high, I aim to place a competitive yet conservative bid. This ensures a balance between the chance of winning and not exceeding my perceived value too much, protecting from potential losses if the second-highest bid is close to my perceived value.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 21 for this round, I need to ensure that I make a profit if I win. Looking at the history, bids vary greatly, but typically the highest bid often does not exceed the 30-40 range unless the perceived value is very high. By bidding 14, I position myself competitively while keeping the bid relatively conservative to maximize potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to or below my bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current perceived value of 72 and the bidding patterns observed in previous rounds, I need to place a bid that is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning while ensuring it is below my perceived value to maintain a profit if I win. In previous rounds, we've seen that bids often range widely, but high bids can reach up to around 60 for high perceived values. By bidding 55, I aim to position myself in a strong place to secure the prize without exceeding my perceived value too much, thereby maximizing my potential profit considering likely competition bids.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 60 for this round and analyzing the bidding patterns from previous rounds, bids for similar perceived values tend to range from the high 30s to mid 50s. By bidding 45, I position myself strongly to win while ensuring that my bid is below my perceived value to maximize potential profit, taking into account that I only pay the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize of 86 and analyzing the bidding patterns from previous rounds, high bids can range widely but sometimes go into the upper 50s or low 60s. To have a competitive chance of winning while ensuring I maximize potential profit, I will bid 65. This bid is high enough to outbid most competitors based on historical data while still leaving a margin for profit when considering the common value.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 68, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 83, 68, 65, 55, 46. The highest bidder won with a bid of 83 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 79 for this round, and learning from the previous rounds where high bids for perceived values above 70 tend to range around the 60s to 70s, bidding 68 gives me a competitive edge while ensuring a reasonable margin to make a profit if I win, considering my value and the second-highest bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 30, the (true) common value of the prize was 27, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 25, 19, 15.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 40 for the prize, I want to place a bid that is competitive yet conservative enough to maximize my profit potential. In previous rounds, the bids have varied widely based on perceived value but often highest bids tend to land between 30 to 70 for higher values. By bidding 30, I aim to balance the risk of overbidding with the potential to secure the prize, ensuring a margin for profit considering my perceived value.'

By bidding 60, I aim to secure the prize with a strong bid without vastly exceeding my perceived value, thus maximizing the likelihood of profit while remaining cautious about the second-highest bid.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 9, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 8, 5, 11, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 8. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for this round's prize is 9, I need to bid strategically to balance between winning the prize and making a profit. Historical data shows that bids can range widely, but often winning bids are substantially higher than this value. My intention is to make a bid that reflects my low perceived value without overcommitting, aiming to avoid bidding wars and potential losses. By bidding 5, I hope to remain competitive in the auction, considering my lower perceived prize value for this round.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 22, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 9, 9, 15, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 9 and paid 9. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 22 and learning from the previous rounds where my bids were typically higher and not always leading to significant profit, I recognize that winning the prize at a lower cost might yield better results. Keeping in mind that the second-highest bid in earlier rounds often varied, bidding 10 aims to strike a balance, ensuring I'm competitive while not risking a significant loss if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 11, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 7, 15, 14, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and paid 7. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 11 for this round's prize and referencing prior rounds, bids have generally ranged widely with winning bids sometimes being significantly higher than the perceived value of the prizes. However, the key is to balance remaining competitive with ensuring a potential profit. In round 5, for instance, the highest payer bid was 15 for a prize value of 22, showing that lower bids can still be relatively competitive. Therefore, by bidding 7, I aim to stay in the running without overcommmitting, given my relatively low perceived value.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 55, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 55, 50, 40, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 68 for this round's prize, I want to balance staying competitive while ensuring a margin for profit. Previously, higher bids such as 60 (with a value of 83) and 35 (with a value of 57) were close but did not always yield significant profit. Based on this history, a bid of 40 aims to secure the prize without overcommitting, considering my perceived higher value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 57, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 64, 45, 41, 37, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 64 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and the trends from previous rounds, bidding around 35-40 seems prudent. Bids higher than this often did not yield additional profit and resulted in higher payments based on the second-highest bid. By bidding 37, I attempt to stay competitive enough to win while keeping potential losses in check, aiming for maximizing profit if the second-highest bid remains reasonable.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 65, 52, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my high perceived value of 84 for this round's prize and looking at historical bids, a competitive and substantial bid is warranted. Previous high bids ranged between 57 and 78, with the winners often facing close amounts on second-highest bids. By bidding 70, I aim to outbid others without excessively overshooting, maximizing the chance of winning while still having a profitable margin.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 76, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 73, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 83, 68, 65, 55, 46. The highest bidder won with a bid of 83 and paid 68. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for this round's prize and analyzing the historical bidding patterns, high bids often resulted in the highest profits when matched well with the second-highest bid. Previous winners with high values usually bid 57 to 78 and paid the second-highest bid, often around 55-57, which kept their net gains positive. By bidding 55, I aim to outbid others enough to capture the prize but also leave a reasonable margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is close.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 27, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 31, 30, 25, 19, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 31 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given the history of previous rounds, I've observed that bidding too high often leads to winning at a cost close to or greater than my perceived value, yielding little to no profit. My value towards the prize this round is 29, and considering previous bidding behaviors where winning bids range widely, I aim to stay competitive yet cautious. By bidding 15, I balance the possibility of winning without overcommitting, potentially maximizing profit if others bid more conservatively.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 38, the (true) common value of the prize was 50, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 45, 38, 37, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round's prize and analyzing previous rounds, previous bids varied significantly with some higher bids not leading to substantial profits due to closely matching second-highest bids. Bids in the 30s and 40s have been competitive but prudent, balancing between being high enough to secure the win and low enough to maximize potential profit.

To maximize my profit, I should bid conservatively, aiming to stay competitive without overpaying. A bid of 11 provides me a chance to win without taking excessive risk, given the historical variance in other bidders' strategies.'

Observing the previous rounds, the highest winning bids have varied significantly, mostly between the 50s and 70s. I aim to bid slightly below my perceived value but still high enough to increase my chances of winning. Therefore, I bid 50 to balance risk and reward effectively.'

In earlier rounds, bids ranged from the teens to the fifties, with the highest winning bids reaching as high as 51.

Previous winners with high values usually bid 57 to 78 and paid the second-highest bid, often around 55-57, which kept their net gains positive. By bidding 55, I aim to outbid others enough to capture the prize but also leave a reasonable margin for profit in case the second-highest bid is close.'

In round 0, the highest bid was 22, and in round 1, it was 39. To balance my chances of winning and making a profit, bidding around half my perceived value seems reasonable. This allows room to earn a profit even if the second-highest bid is significantly lower.'

In those rounds, the highest bids ranged from 22 to 51. By bidding 44, I aim to strike a balance between increasing my chances of winning and making a profit, as it is likely to be below the winning threshold but still competitive.'

In previous rounds, the winning bids have generally ranged between 22 and 78, while the second-highest bids varied less predictably. By bidding half my perceived value, I aim to strike a balance between having a chance to win with a low enough bid to avoid significant losses.'

In round 4, with a value of 18, I bid 9, which was competitive but didn't win. Previous winning bids have awarded the highest bid with positive to negligible profit margins. By bidding 9 again, I aim to balance the realistic chance of winning with the goal to avoid overbidding and running at a loss, especially with such a low perceived value.'

In previous rounds, bidding around half of my perceived value has been competitive yet cautious, which increases my chances of either securing the prize or minimizing my risk.

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round, bidding close to half my value has been a general strategy to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overpayment. Bids in past rounds have shown that winning bids often align with roughly half of the perceived value, particularly when my perceived value is moderate. By bidding 28, I aim to maximize my chances of winning without overextending myself financially.'

This allows me to be competitive while not overextending financially. In round 7, with a perceived value of 57, I bid 28 which did not result in a win but was close to being competitive. Hence, I will stick to a similar approach and bid 28 again this round.'

Historical data shows that bidding around half the value allows me to be competitive without overextending financially. For example, in round 8, my bid of 28 with a value of 57 shows this approach. Hence, to maximize my chances of winning and making a profit, I will bid 41.'

This approach attempts to strike a balance between being competitive and avoiding overbidding. Additionally, historical data indicates that the second-highest bids have often been moderately below the winning bids. By bidding 46, I aim to maximize my chances of winning while still allowing room for a profitable return.'

This approach balances the need to stay competitive while avoiding overbidding. Previous winning bids have also shown that staying in the middle range can be viable. For example, in rounds where my perceived value was above 50, bidding half resulted in competitive yet cautious bids. Hence, to maximize my chances of winning and making a profit, I will bid 19.'

Historical data reveals that winning bids can differ significantly, and profit can vary considerably depending on the actual value and the second-highest bid. A bid of 3 balances the low value of the prize and the need to avoid overbidding, thus minimizing potential losses.'

In the previous rounds, I've observed that bids can vary widely, and the winning bids are often much higher than the perceived value of the prize at lower values.

Previous rounds showed that bidding too close to my value could result in no profit or losses. Bids have shown a lot of variability, so bidding 22 positions me competitively while maintaining a good balance between risk and potential reward.

The winner's profit was -15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25 in this round, a bid of 20 strategically positions me to win if competitors bid conservatively, without risking an excessively high cost. Previous rounds suggest close competition, and this bid balances potential profit with a calculated risk, considering the bid volatility and my perceived value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 21, 13, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I want to submit a bid that is lower than my perceived value to ensure profit potential but high enough to be competitive based on previous bid patterns. Previous rounds have displayed bids ranging widely with some conservativeness. This bid balances risk and reward considering my perceived value and past trends in bidding behavior.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10, 1, 0, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 18 and analyzing the previous rounds' bid patterns where bids ranged widely with conservative bids winning at times, I'll bid 10. This ensures a competitive edge without risking much, aligning with observed trends and my perceived value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 25, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18 and considering prior rounds where even low bids often won, I will bid low to maximize profit while minimizing risk. Observing previous bids, a bid of 5 is competitive without overcommitting, aligning with patterns where conservative bids succeed.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 35, 30, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 55, I observe from prior rounds that bids vary significantly but tend to hover around the 20-45 range for higher values. Bidding 45 positions me competitively while allowing a buffer between my bid and perceived value, maximizing potential profit if I win. This strategy aligns with previous winning bids and balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 25, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for this round, I should aim to bid lower than my perceived value to ensure that I have a chance to profit. Analyzing the previous rounds, there is a tendency for variability in bids with winning bids typically between 20 to 45. By bidding 24, I position myself competitively, balancing a high potential gain if I win with a minimized risk of overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 24. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I should aim to bid competitively but leave a margin to ensure some profit if I win. Analyzing previous rounds, bids vary widely but tend to hover between 20 to 45 for higher values. To maximize my chances and potential profit, I will bid 48. This strategy balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize, considering the variability and my relatively high value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 25, 25, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round, I notice from the previous rounds that winning bids tend to vary widely but are often between the mid-20s to mid-40s. To maximize my profit considering my value and to remain competitive without overpaying, I will bid 28.

Based on typical bidding behavior and the chance that others may value the prize lower or bid conservatively, a bid of 45 might secure the win without significantly cutting into my profit margin.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 6, which is relatively low compared to historical bids, it's unlikely that I will win without overbidding. As seen in previous rounds, higher bids typically lead to losses when the perceived value is low. Therefore, bidding 0 conserves my resources for potentially more favorable rounds.'

In previous rounds, higher bids like 45, 35, and 25 won but often resulted in little to no profit or even losses due to the second-highest bid being close to the highest bid. A bid of 30 strikes a balance, making it competitive enough for a potential win while keeping a margin to ensure profit is more likely if the second-highest bid is around the mid-20s.'

Based on past rounds, where bids have often peaked around 45 and 40, bidding 40 positions me competitively while maintaining a reasonable margin for profit to account for the second-highest bid potentially being high but lower than my own.'

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 21, 13, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I want to submit a bid that is lower than my perceived value to ensure profit potential but high enough to be competitive based on previous bid patterns. Previous rounds have displayed bids ranging widely with some conservativeness. This bid balances risk and reward considering my perceived value and past trends in bidding behavior.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10, 1, 0, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 18 and analyzing the previous rounds' bid patterns where bids ranged widely with conservative bids winning at times, I'll bid 10. This ensures a competitive edge without risking much, aligning with observed trends and my perceived value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 25, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18 and considering prior rounds where even low bids often won, I will bid low to maximize profit while minimizing risk. Observing previous bids, a bid of 5 is competitive without overcommitting, aligning with patterns where conservative bids succeed.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 35, 30, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 55, I observe from prior rounds that bids vary significantly but tend to hover around the 20-45 range for higher values. Bidding 45 positions me competitively while allowing a buffer between my bid and perceived value, maximizing potential profit if I win. This strategy aligns with previous winning bids and balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 25, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for this round, I should aim to bid lower than my perceived value to ensure that I have a chance to profit. Analyzing the previous rounds, there is a tendency for variability in bids with winning bids typically between 20 to 45. By bidding 24, I position myself competitively, balancing a high potential gain if I win with a minimized risk of overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 24. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I should aim to bid competitively but leave a margin to ensure some profit if I win. Analyzing previous rounds, bids vary widely but tend to hover between 20 to 45 for higher values. To maximize my chances and potential profit, I will bid 48. This strategy balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize, considering the variability and my relatively high value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 25, 25, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round, I notice from the previous rounds that winning bids tend to vary widely but are often between the mid-20s to mid-40s. To maximize my profit considering my value and to remain competitive without overpaying, I will bid 28. This allows for a good potential profit if I win while avoiding the risk of bidding too high.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 59, 50, 50, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 86 for this round, I should aim to bid aggressively to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a sizable margin for profit. Observing prior rounds, bids have varied significantly, but real competition has often been in the higher range when the perceived value is higher. By bidding 65, I balance the strong probability of securing the prize without bidding too close to my value, thus maximizing my total profit while considering the variability in competitors' bids.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 81 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

Based on typical bidding behavior and the chance that others may value the prize lower or bid conservatively, a bid of 45 might secure the win without significantly cutting into my profit margin.'

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 6, which is relatively low compared to historical bids, it's unlikely that I will win without overbidding. As seen in previous rounds, higher bids typically lead to losses when the perceived value is low. Therefore, bidding 0 conserves my resources for potentially more favorable rounds.'

In previous rounds, higher bids like 45, 35, and 25 won but often resulted in little to no profit or even losses due to the second-highest bid being close to the highest bid. A bid of 30 strikes a balance, making it competitive enough for a potential win while keeping a margin to ensure profit is more likely if the second-highest bid is around the mid-20s.'

Based on past rounds, where bids have often peaked around 45 and 40, bidding 40 positions me competitively while maintaining a reasonable margin for profit to account for the second-highest bid potentially being high but lower than my own.'

From previous rounds, we see bids clustered around 40 and 45 as potentially winning values but often resulting in high payments close or equal to the bid.

If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid. All other bidders' earnings will not change.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 21', 'history': \"In round 0, Your (perceived) total value was 54, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 47, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 40, 39, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 54 and considering a reasonable estimate of competitors' bids based on previous rounds, bidding 40 balances the risk and reward. It allows a good chance to secure the prize while ensuring profit if I win, considering the payment would be the second-highest bid.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -15.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 20, 20, 10, 10, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 20 and paid 20. The winner's profit was -15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 25 in this round, a bid of 20 strategically positions me to win if competitors bid conservatively, without risking an excessively high cost. Previous rounds suggest close competition, and this bid balances potential profit with a calculated risk, considering the bid volatility and my perceived value.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 13, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 3, 21, 13, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 18 in this round, I want to submit a bid that is lower than my perceived value to ensure profit potential but high enough to be competitive based on previous bid patterns. Previous rounds have displayed bids ranging widely with some conservativeness. This bid balances risk and reward considering my perceived value and past trends in bidding behavior.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 0, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 3, 10, 1, 0, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 18 and analyzing the previous rounds' bid patterns where bids ranged widely with conservative bids winning at times, I'll bid 10. This ensures a competitive edge without risking much, aligning with observed trends and my perceived value.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 18, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -18. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 25, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 18 and considering prior rounds where even low bids often won, I will bid low to maximize profit while minimizing risk. Observing previous bids, a bid of 5 is competitive without overcommitting, aligning with patterns where conservative bids succeed.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 35, 30, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 55, I observe from prior rounds that bids vary significantly but tend to hover around the 20-45 range for higher values. Bidding 45 positions me competitively while allowing a buffer between my bid and perceived value, maximizing potential profit if I win. This strategy aligns with previous winning bids and balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -19. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 25, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 34 for this round, I should aim to bid lower than my perceived value to ensure that I have a chance to profit. Analyzing the previous rounds, there is a tendency for variability in bids with winning bids typically between 20 to 45. By bidding 24, I position myself competitively, balancing a high potential gain if I win with a minimized risk of overpaying.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 24. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 67, I should aim to bid competitively but leave a margin to ensure some profit if I win. Analyzing previous rounds, bids vary widely but tend to hover between 20 to 45 for higher values. To maximize my chances and potential profit, I will bid 48. This strategy balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize, considering the variability and my relatively high value this round.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 25, 25, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 38 for this round, I notice from the previous rounds that winning bids tend to vary widely but are often between the mid-20s to mid-40s. To maximize my profit considering my value and to remain competitive without overpaying, I will bid 28. This allows for a good potential profit if I win while avoiding the risk of bidding too high.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 86, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 10.\\nYour total profit is 2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 59, 50, 50, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 86 for this round, I should aim to bid aggressively to increase my chances of winning while ensuring a sizable margin for profit. Observing prior rounds, bids have varied significantly, but real competition has often been in the higher range when the perceived value is higher. By bidding 65, I balance the strong probability of securing the prize without bidding too close to my value, thus maximizing my total profit while considering the variability in competitors' bids.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 61, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 6.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 55, 55, 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 81, and considering previous rounds where higher values often required aggressive bids to win, I'll bid 61. This strikes a balance between competitive bidding and ensuring a reasonable profit margin should I win. Prior rounds suggest competitive bids range widely, often in the 40s-60s for high perceived values. This bid optimizes my chances to win while maximizing potential profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 21 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 12, the (true) common value of the prize was 18, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 25, 20, 15, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -2.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 30, I'll bid conservatively to avoid potential overbidding. Historical data shows variability in bids and final profits. A bid of 12 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing potential loss if the second-highest bid is lower than expected. Balancing caution and the potential value of the prize is necessary based on past rounds, especially with observed high variability in second-highest bid amounts.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 39, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 35, 30, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 44, I want to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying. Previous rounds showed that bidding too close to my value could result in no profit or losses. Bids have shown a lot of variability, so bidding 22 positions me competitively while maintaining a good balance between risk and potential reward. This strategy maximizes my chances of winning the prize at a cost lower than my perceived value, thereby ensuring a positive profit if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 34, you bid 19, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 25, 25, 24, 19. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on the historical bids, the winning and second-highest bids have varied significantly. Given my current perceived value of 34, I should bid conservatively yet competitively. A bid of 19 allows me to stay within reach of other potential high bids while minimizing the risk of overbidding and incurring losses from a lower second-highest bid. This strategy aims to balance caution and competitiveness to maximize my total profit.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 53, you bid 24, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 40, 40, 38, 24. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for this round, I aim to bid conservatively to avoid overpaying based on historical bidding patterns. Previous rounds have shown winning bids significantly varied and sometimes overvalued the prize. A bid of 24 positions me to potentially win while minimizing the risk of overbidding compared to my perceived value. This strategy balances caution and competitiveness to maximize my overall profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 28, you bid 17, the (true) common value of the prize was 23, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 28, 25, 25, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 28. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 28 and analyzing past bidding behavior, I've noticed that past rounds exhibit significant variability in bids and second-highest values. By bidding 17, I stay competitive enough to potentially win the prize while minimizing the risk of overbidding, as the second-highest bids have frequently been considerably below the winner's bid. This way, I optimize my chances of profiting from the prize while mitigating potential losses.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 83, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 69, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 59, 50, 50, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 83 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bid patterns, I want to bid significantly below my value to maximize the potential for profit while aiming to avoid the winner\u2019s curse of overpaying. Historical data shows that winning bids have often been well below the highest perceived value, with second-highest bids frequently being considerably lower. Bidding 43 balances competitiveness and caution, aiming to secure the prize if competitors undervalue it, minimizing potential overbidding issues.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 42, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 55, 55, 50, 42.

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 33, I need to place a bid that is competitive but does not risk overpaying. Analyzing previous rounds, placing a bid around 25 often results in a reasonable chance of winning without significant risk of loss. It balances the need to compete with others while considering typical bid ranges and their outcomes.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 83 for the prize this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive enough to win while ensuring a significant profit margin. From previous rounds, typical winning bids often range between 30 and 48, and considering my high perceived value, a bid of 59 should provide a good chance of winning while maintaining a reasonable buffer for the second-highest bid, maximizing my potential profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -2. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 55, 55, 50, 42.

Previous rounds indicate that winning bids often range from about 25 to 60. By bidding 50, I position myself with a strong chance of winning while providing a reasonable margin between my bid and the perceived value to ensure profitability.'

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 29 and looking at previous rounds where bids have varied widely but generally been higher than low-value bids, I aim to bid conservatively. Analyzing the patterns, bids of around 18 should be competitive without heavily risking overpayment, especially since other bids often exceed values in the 20s and 30s.

Observing prior rounds, bids have varied significantly, but real competition has often been in the higher range when the perceived value is higher. By bidding 65, I balance the strong probability of securing the prize without bidding too close to my value, thus maximizing my total profit while considering the variability in competitors' bids.'

This strikes a balance between competitive bidding and ensuring a reasonable profit margin should I win. Prior rounds suggest competitive bids range widely, often in the 40s-60s for high perceived values. This bid optimizes my chances to win while maximizing potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 5 and paid 3.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 3 and paid 10. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is only 6 this round, bidding a very low amount minimizes my risk of incurring a loss if my bid is successful. In the previous rounds, I've observed that bids can vary widely, and the winning bids are often much higher than the perceived value of the prize at lower values. Therefore, bidding 1 gives me a small chance of winning without significantly risking a loss.'

From previous rounds, the highest bid tends to vary widely, but generally, bids around 30 to 45 have been successful without excessive overbidding. A bid of 40 positions me well to win the prize while managing the risk of overpaying and maximizing potential profit.'

In previous rounds, bids around 25 to 45 often win, depending on the overall perceived values of other bidders.

Previous rounds show bids often vary widely, but bids around 37-45 are common winners when the perceived values are mid-range.

From previous rounds, typical winning bids often range between 30 and 48, and considering my high perceived value, a bid of 59 should provide a good chance of winning while maintaining a reasonable buffer for the second-highest bid, maximizing my potential profit if I win.'

Observing prior rounds, bids have varied significantly, but real competition has often been in the higher range when the perceived value is higher.

Previous rounds have shown that low bids can sometimes win due to variability in competitors' bids. By bidding 10, I balance the risk and reward, maximizing potential profit while mitigating potential losses if the true value or competitors' bids are lower than my perceived value.'

In previous rounds, the bids have varied widely, but conservatively bidding around 60% of my perceived value provides a balance between a competitive bid and cost control, especially because the highest second bid tends to be fairly high.'

In past rounds, high bids often resulted in small or negative profits due to the second-highest bid being significantly lower. Therefore, bidding 50 gives me a strong chance to win while managing the risk of overpaying.'

Historical bids range quite variably, with bids like 45, 20, and 5 appearing.

In previous rounds, higher bids like 45, 35, and 25 won but often resulted in little to no profit or even losses due to the second-highest bid being close to the highest bid. A bid of 30 strikes a balance, making it competitive enough for a potential win while keeping a margin to ensure profit is more likely if the second-highest bid is around the mid-20s.'

Based on past rounds, where bids have often peaked around 45 and 40, bidding 40 positions me competitively while maintaining a reasonable margin for profit to account for the second-highest bid potentially being high but lower than my own.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 40, I want to bid competitively but leave enough margin for profit. From previous rounds, we see bids clustered around 40 and 45 as potentially winning values but often resulting in high payments close or equal to the bid.

Historical data shows that high winning bids are often around 40 to 45, with the second-highest bids usually within a close range. To account for variability and based on my relatively high perceived value, bidding 50 strikes a balance between securing a win and leaving enough margin for a potential profit.'

Historical data shows that winning bids tend to be in the range of 45 to 65, with high perceived values like 75 resulting in competitive bids around 50 to 65. Therefore, a bid of 55 should give me a good chance of winning without overly cutting into my profit, assuming the second-highest bid follows a similar pattern.'

Analyzing previous rounds, bids vary widely but tend to hover between 20 to 45 for higher values. To maximize my chances and potential profit, I will bid 48. This strategy balances risk with a strong chance to secure the prize, considering the variability and my relatively high value this round.'

Observing prior rounds, bids have varied significantly, but real competition has often been in the higher range when the perceived value is higher. By bidding 65, I balance the strong probability of securing the prize without bidding too close to my value, thus maximizing my total profit while considering the variability in competitors' bids.'

This strikes a balance between competitive bidding and ensuring a reasonable profit margin should I win. Prior rounds suggest competitive bids range widely, often in the 40s-60s for high perceived values. This bid optimizes my chances to win while maximizing potential profit.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 21, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 8. \\nAll the bids for this round were 18, 15, 10, 10, 0.

The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 21 for this round and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bidding low can help in avoiding significant losses while maintaining competitiveness. Previous rounds have shown that low bids can sometimes win due to variability in competitors' bids. By bidding 10, I balance the risk and reward, maximizing potential profit while mitigating potential losses if the true value or competitors' bids are lower than my perceived value.'

In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 71, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 61, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 55, 55, 50, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 71 this round, I want to bid high enough to maximize the chance of winning while ensuring a strong profit margin. Historical data shows that winning bids tend to be in the range of 45 to 65, with high perceived values like 75 resulting in competitive bids around 50 to 65. Therefore, a bid of 55 should give me a good chance of winning without overly cutting into my profit, assuming the second-highest bid follows a similar pattern.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 0, the (true) common value of the prize was 11, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 18, 15, 10, 10, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 18 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is only 15 in this round, and observing that previous rounds where I had low values (5, 6, 9) have led to me bidding 0 and conserving resources, it is unlikely I will win without significantly overbidding relative to the prize value. Therefore, bidding 0 conserves my resources for potentially more favorable rounds where my perceived value is higher.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 39, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 37, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 40, 31, 25, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 31. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 39, I need to bid strategically for a competitive bid while still ensuring some room for profit. From previous rounds, competitive bids range from the high 20s to mid-40s, and the second-highest bids are often close but slightly lower. A bid of 25 positions me to potentially win if the second-highest bid is around or under 20, providing a balance between being competitive and maximizing profit.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 11.\\nYour total profit is 16. \\nAll the bids for this round were 45, 40, 40, 40, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 45 and paid 40. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68, historical bid data indicates that competitive bids often range in the mid-40s to mid-50s with second-highest bids not far behind, which can impact profit margins negatively if I bid too high. A bid of 45 strikes a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win and leaving room for profit considering that other high bids tend to cluster close to one another.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Ethel. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 93 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.
