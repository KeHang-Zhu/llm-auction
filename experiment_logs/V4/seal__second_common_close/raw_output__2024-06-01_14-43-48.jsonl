The second-highest bids have varied around 30, 45, and 61. With my value for the prize at 78, I want to place a competitive bid to secure the prize while considering profitability. Bidding 71 should give me a strong chance of winning without overpaying too much, allowing for potential profit, especially if the second-highest bid is around 60-65.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, and considering the bidding history, bids generally range higher when higher-perceived values are presented. Bidding 53 offers a strategically sound and competitive bid to outdo others, while allowing some room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the high 40s or low 50s, reflecting patterns from previous rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value for the prize is 30 and analyzing previous rounds, bids tend to be competitive and often result in small profits or even losses for the winners. To strike a balance between a competitive bid and the risk of overpaying, I will bid slightly below my perceived value. This allows me to potentially win the prize without significantly overpaying, hence preserving or even improving my total profit. Bidding 27 should offer a reasonable chance of winning while minimizing the risk of a significant loss.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9 and analyzing the previous rounds, it is evident that winning bids often exceed the second-highest bid by a small margin, causing some winners to take a loss. Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 58 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

To strike a balance between a competitive bid and the risk of overpaying, I will bid slightly below my perceived value.

The highest and second-highest bids in past rounds have been quite variable and often high.

In the last round, lower bids were placed (20, 20, 22) and, given the perceived lower value, bidding a bit above the lowest bid of 20 from the previous round could make my bid competitive without risking too much value.

This balances the high chance of winning the auction with a decent margin above typical highest bids from previous rounds (65, 50, 40).

In previous rounds, highest bids ranged from 40 to 75, with second-highest bids usually around 70-75% of the highest bid.

Given that my perceived value is relatively low, bidding 22 gives me a small but potential chance to win if others undervalue the prize while minimizing my potential loss if I don't win.'

In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 45, 45, 45, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 58 this round, I want to bid high enough to potentially win without bidding too much and risking a loss. In the previous round, the winning bid was 40, and the second-highest was 30. To maximize my chances of winning while keeping a good margin, I will bid 45. This gives me a reasonable chance of winning without overshooting too much, considering the other bids from the last round.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 55, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 69 this round, I want to bid competitively without significantly overshooting my value. In the previous rounds, the winning bids were 40 and 50, with the second-highest bids being 30 and 45, respectively. Based on this pattern, a bid of 65 allows me to be competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing the risk of paying too much if I have to pay the second-highest bid. This approach aims to balance the chance of winning the prize with the objective of sustaining a good profit margin.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 67, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 72, 71, 68, 65, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 67 this round, I want to bid competitively without overbidding to minimize the risk of a negative profit. In previous rounds, the highest bids were 40, 50, and 65, with second-highest bids at 30, 45, and 61. A bid of 50 is likely to be competitive while offering a good balance between winning the prize and maintaining a profit margin.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 55, 53, 53, 52, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 this round, I would bid 55 to remain competitive while avoiding overbidding excessively. From previous rounds, the bids have shown a range of activity with highest bids often in the 60+ range, and second-highest bids frequently around the 45-55 range. A bid of 55 has a good chance of winning while keeping a good profit margin should I win, maximizing my likelihood of a positive outcome. This strategy aims to balance competitiveness and the risk of high payment.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 26, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 32, 27, 22, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 26, I aim to bid conservatively to maximize my profit potential while ensuring I do not overbid. Previous rounds have shown that the highest bids tend to be significantly higher than my value this round. Bidding 20 allows me to be competitive while minimizing the risk of a negative profit scenario if I win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 8, I need to bid conservatively to minimize the risk of a loss. Previous rounds have consistently shown that the highest bids are much higher than my value, often exceeding 20 or 30. Bidding 5 provides a chance to win if others bid very low, but more importantly, it protects me from the risk of paying more than the prize is worth to me.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 44, I want to bid high enough to have a competitive chance of winning but conservatively enough to ensure a profit if I win. Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids have generally been quite high, frequently exceeding 50, while second-highest bids tend to vary but often fall in the range of 30-50. A bid of 35 balances my aim of competitiveness and profit margin, considering that my perceived value is 44 and I need to avoid overbidding.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 58, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47.

The second-highest bids have varied around 30, 45, and 61. With my value for the prize at 78, I want to place a competitive bid to secure the prize while considering profitability.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 60, I need to make a competitive bid without overpaying to maximize my chances of profit. From the history, I know previous winning bids and second-highest bids: 40/30, 50/45, 65/61, and 75/72. Given these trends, I should aim for a bid that balances competitiveness with profitability. A bid of 53 places me in a strong position without excessively reducing my profit margin if I win.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 32, 27, 22, 20, 20.

To increase my chances of securing a profit, I need to place a competitive bid that is slightly below my value of 36. Given the trend of second-highest bids being relatively close to the highest bid, bidding 32 positions me to potentially win if the second-highest bid remains in the expected range, while still securing a margin for profit.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and learning from previous history where the bids have generally been competitive but have led to negative profits for the winners, I will place a bid of 16. This is close enough to my value to be competitive but leaves room to potentially win the auction without overpaying relative to the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 48 and considering the previous rounds, I notice that bids have generally been competitive but close to each other, often leading to the highest bid and second-highest bid being relatively near. Based on this pattern, I aim to bid slightly below my value to maximize my chances of winning without significantly reducing my profit margin if the second-highest bid remains close. Therefore, I choose to bid 44.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I need to place a bid that positions me strongly while maintaining a potential for profit. The historical bids have shown that second-highest bids are usually quite close to the highest, sometimes only differing by a few points. To align with this trend and maximize my profit, I will bid 48. This should be competitive enough to win without overpaying significantly if the second-highest bid remains in the expected range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I need to place a bid that maximizes my chances of winning while maintaining a good profit margin. In previous rounds, the second-highest bids have often been very close to the highest bids (e.g., 65/61, 75/72, 55/54). To maximize my profit, I will emulate these past patterns by bidding 72. This should be competitive enough to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable gap if the second-highest bid is close, thus maximizing my potential profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 57, I want to bid an amount that is competitive yet leaves room for profit. Historically, the second-highest bids have typically been close to the highest bids. For example, in round 9, the highest bid was 85 and the second-highest bid was 77.

Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.'

Higher winning bids in previous rounds tended to have second-highest bids closely trailing behind. By bidding 75, I ensure a strong competitive bid that should help win the prize while allowing room for a reasonable profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

To maximize my chances of winning while aiming for a margin of profit, I will bid slightly below my value. This strategy maintains competitiveness but avoids overpaying. Considering historical trends, a bid of 47 positions me well to win without significantly reducing profit margins if the second-highest bid is close, as observed in previous rounds.'

Previous highest bids have ranged from 33 to 85, often with a significant spread in second-highest bids. Bidding 57 aims to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing my potential loss if I end up paying a high second-highest bid.

In the last round, lower bids were placed (20, 20, 22) and, given the perceived lower value, bidding a bit above the lowest bid of 20 from the previous round could make my bid competitive without risking too much value.

To have a competitive yet sensible bid, I should place it lower than my value but potentially higher than the average second-highest bid. Recent second-highest bids have been around 30-45. By bidding 34, I aim to increase my chances of winning with a bid that's low enough to ensure profitability if I win, considering the variability in the perceived values and bids from other players.'

In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 55, 53, 53, 52, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 60, I need to make a competitive bid without overpaying to maximize my chances of profit. From the history, I know previous winning bids and second-highest bids: 40/30, 50/45, 65/61, and 75/72. Given these trends, I should aim for a bid that balances competitiveness with profitability. A bid of 53 places me in a strong position without excessively reducing my profit margin if I win.'

To increase my chances of securing a profit, I need to place a competitive bid that is slightly below my value of 36. Given the trend of second-highest bids being relatively close to the highest bid, bidding 32 positions me to potentially win if the second-highest bid remains in the expected range, while still securing a margin for profit.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 19, you bid 16, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19 and learning from previous history where the bids have generally been competitive but have led to negative profits for the winners, I will place a bid of 16. This is close enough to my value to be competitive but leaves room to potentially win the auction without overpaying relative to the second-highest bid.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 44, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 48 and considering the previous rounds, I notice that bids have generally been competitive but close to each other, often leading to the highest bid and second-highest bid being relatively near. Based on this pattern, I aim to bid slightly below my value to maximize my chances of winning without significantly reducing my profit margin if the second-highest bid remains close. Therefore, I choose to bid 44.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I need to place a bid that positions me strongly while maintaining a potential for profit. The historical bids have shown that second-highest bids are usually quite close to the highest, sometimes only differing by a few points. To align with this trend and maximize my profit, I will bid 48. This should be competitive enough to win without overpaying significantly if the second-highest bid remains in the expected range.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 72, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I need to place a bid that maximizes my chances of winning while maintaining a good profit margin. In previous rounds, the second-highest bids have often been very close to the highest bids (e.g., 65/61, 75/72, 55/54). To maximize my profit, I will emulate these past patterns by bidding 72. This should be competitive enough to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable gap if the second-highest bid is close, thus maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 57, I want to bid an amount that is competitive yet leaves room for profit. Historically, the second-highest bids have typically been close to the highest bids. For example, in round 9, the highest bid was 85 and the second-highest bid was 77. Considering this trend, a bid of 51 should be competitive while still allowing for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to or above this amount.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 52 and learning from past rounds, other bidders often place bids close to their values, leading to high second-highest bids. To maximize my chances of winning while aiming for a margin of profit, I will bid slightly below my value. This strategy maintains competitiveness but avoids overpaying. Considering historical trends, a bid of 47 positions me well to win without significantly reducing profit margins if the second-highest bid is close, as observed in previous rounds.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60.

To increase my chances of winning while still aiming for a decent profit margin, I opt to bid 57. This positioning should be strong enough to be competitive while allowing a sufficient buffer for potential profit if the second-highest bid remains in the expected competitive range.'

In the last rounds, the winning bids were 40 and 50, with second-highest bids being 30 and 45, respectively.

The second-highest bids have varied around 30, 45, and 61. With my value for the prize at 78, I want to place a competitive bid to secure the prize while considering profitability.

Bidding 53 offers a strategically sound and competitive bid to outdo others, while allowing some room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the high 40s or low 50s, reflecting patterns from previous rounds.'

To strike a balance between a competitive bid and the risk of overpaying, I will bid slightly below my perceived value. This allows me to potentially win the prize without significantly overpaying, hence preserving or even improving my total profit. Bidding 27 should offer a reasonable chance of winning while minimizing the risk of a significant loss.'

Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.'

Higher winning bids in previous rounds tended to have second-highest bids closely trailing behind. By bidding 75, I ensure a strong competitive bid that should help win the prize while allowing room for a reasonable profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Past rounds show that winning bids are often close to perceived values, with second-highest bids usually just a few units lower. By bidding 59, I aim to strike a balance between making a competitive bid and ensuring potential profitability if the second-highest bid falls in the low-to-mid 50s range.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids often slightly exceed other competitors' bids, but given the low perceived value, minimizing risk is key.

Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47.

By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53.

Reviewing the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values but slightly lower. By bidding 53, I strategically position myself in the competitive range while leaving room for potential profit even if the second-highest bid is relatively high.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 17 and analyzing the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds, bidding around 14 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 84 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The historical bids have shown that second-highest bids are usually quite close to the highest, sometimes only differing by a few points.

In previous rounds, the second-highest bids have often been very close to the highest bids (e.g., 65/61, 75/72, 55/54). To maximize my profit, I will emulate these past patterns by bidding 72. This should be competitive enough to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable gap if the second-highest bid is close, thus maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 27 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds' bidding patterns where bids often ranged from the high 50s to low 70s depending on the perceived value, I aim to place a bid that balances my chance to win with the risk of overbidding. Given that my perceived value is relatively low, bidding 22 gives me a small but potential chance to win if others undervalue the prize while minimizing my potential loss if I don't win.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 25, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 25 this round, I want to secure a chance to win without overbidding. Previous rounds indicate that winning bids can vary significantly, but recent winning bids were often higher than 25. By bidding 20, I aim to stay competitive yet minimize the risk of excessive loss if I end up losing.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my value of 55 for this round and reviewing the historical bids and outcomes, I notice that successful bids typically aren't a significant portion above the second-highest bid, often within a range of about 5-10 units. To maximize my chance of winning this auction without excessively risking my profit margin, I aim for a bid of 48. This value is competitive considering patterns in previous rounds and balances the need for winning against the potential risk of overpayment.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 55, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 55 for this round and reviewing the historical bids and outcomes, successful bids have typically been within a competitive range but not excessively above the next highest bid. For example, in previous rounds, bids around 45, 48, and 55 were competitive but not always high enough to secure the win. To maximize my chance of winning this auction while maintaining a good margin for profit, I aim for a bid of 50, which balances competitiveness with minimizing potential loss if I win and have to pay the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 88, you bid 76, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -6. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my high value of 88 for this round and considering the aggressive bidding patterns observed in previous rounds where the highest bids typically range from the low 50s to mid 70s, I will aim to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning without significantly cutting into my potential profit. I will bid 76, which is slightly above the highest observed successful bid, thus balancing the risk of losing with the need for a high bid to secure the win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 62, you bid 57, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for this round and studying the historical bid patterns, it's evident that placing a bid slightly below my perceived value can be a good strategy. Previous highest bids have ranged from 33 to 85, often with a significant spread in second-highest bids. Bidding 57 aims to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing my potential loss if I end up paying a high second-highest bid. This bid also leaves a reasonable margin for profit based on my perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round and observing the historical patterns where the second-highest bids have generally been close to but not exceeding the highest bids, I want to place a competitive bid without overbidding. In previous rounds, such as rounds 8 and 10, slightly lower bids were successful. Hence, I aim to balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by bidding 51. This positions me well to potentially win while mitigating high payment risks.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 56, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53.

In previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been close to the perceived values but with a reasonable spread. To maximize my chance of winning while leaving a margin for profit, I will bid 56. This bid is sufficiently competitive while allowing room to benefit if I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds where the highest winning bids and second-highest bids varied, I will place a conservative bid. Historically, placing a bid close to my perceived value usually does not lead to a win unless the competition undervalues their bids. By bidding 6, I minimize potential loss while keeping a small chance of winning if others bid lower than expected.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65.

The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for this round and considering the historical bidding patterns where the highest bids vary significantly but successful bids often fall in the 50-65 range, I will aim for a bid of 65. This is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning the prize while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin based on the expected second-highest bid. Moreover, previous rounds indicate that overly aggressive bids often result in lower or negative profits, so a bid of 65 balances competitiveness with profitability.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 77 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that the prize value for me is 28 this round, I should aim to bid high enough to have a chance of winning but also cautiously to ensure I still make a profit. Since the values are redrawn each round and unique adjustments can push individual perceptions of value up or down, I will bid around the midpoint of my value. This strategy balances the potential to win without overbidding and risking a loss scenario where the second-highest bid is close to or exceeds my value.'

In the previous round, the winning bid was 40, and the second-highest was 30. To maximize my chances of winning while keeping a good margin, I will bid 45. This gives me a reasonable chance of winning without overshooting too much, considering the other bids from the last round.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 69, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -9.\\nYour total profit is -9. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 55, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61.

In the previous rounds, the winning bids were 40 and 50, with the second-highest bids being 30 and 45, respectively. Based on this pattern, a bid of 65 allows me to be competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing the risk of paying too much if I have to pay the second-highest bid. This approach aims to balance the chance of winning the prize with the objective of sustaining a good profit margin.'

In previous rounds, the highest bids were 40, 50, and 65, with second-highest bids at 30, 45, and 61. A bid of 50 is likely to be competitive while offering a good balance between winning the prize and maintaining a profit margin.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 this round, I would bid 55 to remain competitive while avoiding overbidding excessively. From previous rounds, the bids have shown a range of activity with highest bids often in the 60+ range, and second-highest bids frequently around the 45-55 range. A bid of 55 has a good chance of winning while keeping a good profit margin should I win, maximizing my likelihood of a positive outcome. This strategy aims to balance competitiveness and the risk of high payment.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 8, I need to bid conservatively to minimize the risk of a loss. Previous rounds have consistently shown that the highest bids are much higher than my value, often exceeding 20 or 30. Bidding 5 provides a chance to win if others bid very low, but more importantly, it protects me from the risk of paying more than the prize is worth to me.'

Reviewing previous rounds, winning bids have generally been quite high, frequently exceeding 50, while second-highest bids tend to vary but often fall in the range of 30-50. A bid of 35 balances my aim of competitiveness and profit margin, considering that my perceived value is 44 and I need to avoid overbidding.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 58, and based on previous bidding behaviors, winning bids often range between 50 and 75, but tend to be quite high. To have a competitive chance of winning while aiming for a positive profit, I will bid 50. This approach helps maximize the likelihood of winning without excessively overbidding and risking a negative profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 92, you bid 85, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -5.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize this round is 92, I need to bid high to have a strong chance of winning. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been quite high (often well above 50) and second-highest bids generally fall in a high range as well. By bidding 85, I am positioning myself to win while still aiming to minimize the gap between my bid and the second-highest bid, thereby maximizing my potential profit without overshooting too much.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48.

By bidding 50, I aim to be competitive enough to win the prize while still maintaining a margin that could result in a positive profit. This strategy balances the risk of overbidding while maximizing the chance of winning.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47.

Looking at previous rounds, the winning bids have frequently been quite high, often ranging between 50 to 75. However, bidding too high has often resulted in minimal or negative profits. By bidding 60, I aim to be competitive enough to potentially win while maintaining a safer margin for profit if I do win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 70 this round, I need to bid competitively while still ensuring a positive profit margin. From previous rounds, it's evident that the second-highest bid tends to be slightly below the highest bids, which often range from around 50 to 75. By bidding 60, I aim to position myself strongly enough to win while still leaving a reasonable buffer if I end up paying the second-highest bid. This strategy balances competitiveness and profit potential.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is only 13 this round, I should bid conservatively to minimize the risk of paying close to or above my perceived value. In previous rounds, bidding has frequently been high, often above the common value, leading to negative profits. By bidding 5, I stand a small chance of winning if others bid extremely low, but more importantly, this conservative bid minimizes the risk of a significant loss.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 95 for this round, I need to bid high to have a strong chance of winning. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, the highest bids tend to be quite high, frequently exceeding 50 and occasionally approaching 80 or higher. The second-highest bid often falls slightly below the highest bid but is generally in a similar range. By bidding 80, I position myself to win while aiming to leave a substantial margin for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is considerably lower.

In previous rounds, I observed that bids tend to cluster around the mid to high range and the second-highest bid is often within 5 to 10 units of the highest bid.

Observing the previous rounds, the winning bids tend to cluster high, leading to losses when bids are too close to perceived value.

Observing the previous rounds, the highest winning bids typically range significantly higher, and the second-highest bid is often close.

In previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to cluster around 10-15 units of variance from other bids, so bidding around 41 should place me in a competitive position without excessively overbidding, which could help maximize my potential profit.'

Reviewing the previous 7 rounds, successful bids clustered around 10-20 units below my perceived value. High bids often resulted in significant losses when the second-highest bid was close to the winning bid.

To maximize my chances of winning and securing a profit, I should bid a high but reasonable amount.

Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.'

By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.'

Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.'

Observing the trend, second-highest bids tend to be below the highest bid by a margin of about 5 to 10 units.

Based on this pattern, I aim to bid slightly below my value to maximize my chances of winning without significantly reducing my profit margin if the second-highest bid remains close. Therefore, I choose to bid 44.'

The historical bids have shown that second-highest bids are usually quite close to the highest, sometimes only differing by a few points. To align with this trend and maximize my profit, I will bid 48. This should be competitive enough to win without overpaying significantly if the second-highest bid remains in the expected range.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 82, I need to place a bid that maximizes my chances of winning while maintaining a good profit margin. In previous rounds, the second-highest bids have often been very close to the highest bids (e.g., 65/61, 75/72, 55/54). To maximize my profit, I will emulate these past patterns by bidding 72. This should be competitive enough to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable gap if the second-highest bid is close, thus maximizing my potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 57, I want to bid an amount that is competitive yet leaves room for profit. Historically, the second-highest bids have typically been close to the highest bids. For example, in round 9, the highest bid was 85 and the second-highest bid was 77. Considering this trend, a bid of 51 should be competitive while still allowing for a potential profit if the second-highest bid is close to or above this amount.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 47, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 52 and learning from past rounds, other bidders often place bids close to their values, leading to high second-highest bids. To maximize my chances of winning while aiming for a margin of profit, I will bid slightly below my value. This strategy maintains competitiveness but avoids overpaying. Considering historical trends, a bid of 47 positions me well to win without significantly reducing profit margins if the second-highest bid is close, as observed in previous rounds.'

To increase my chances of winning while still aiming for a decent profit margin, I opt to bid 57. This positioning should be strong enough to be competitive while allowing a sufficient buffer for potential profit if the second-highest bid remains in the expected competitive range.'

To maximize my chances of profit, I need to place a competitive yet conservative bid that provides a buffer for profit relative to potential higher second-highest bids. Bidding 12 aligns well with the observed patterns, ensuring competitiveness while aiming to avoid overpaying.'

For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings the (true) common value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid.

In the last rounds, the winning bids were 40 and 50, with second-highest bids being 30 and 45, respectively. Bidding 61 should give me a strong chance of winning the prize while ensuring I do not overpay significantly, allowing for a potential profit even if the second-highest bid is slightly lower.'

The second-highest bids have varied around 30, 45, and 61. With my value for the prize at 78, I want to place a competitive bid to secure the prize while considering profitability. Bidding 71 should give me a strong chance of winning without overpaying too much, allowing for potential profit, especially if the second-highest bid is around 60-65.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, and considering the bidding history, bids generally range higher when higher-perceived values are presented. Bidding 53 offers a strategically sound and competitive bid to outdo others, while allowing some room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the high 40s or low 50s, reflecting patterns from previous rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value for the prize is 30 and analyzing previous rounds, bids tend to be competitive and often result in small profits or even losses for the winners. To strike a balance between a competitive bid and the risk of overpaying, I will bid slightly below my perceived value. This allows me to potentially win the prize without significantly overpaying, hence preserving or even improving my total profit. Bidding 27 should offer a reasonable chance of winning while minimizing the risk of a significant loss.'

Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.'

To strategically place a competitive bid and maximize my chances of winning while minimizing the likelihood of overpaying, I will bid 53. This approach should balance between securing the prize and achieving potential profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls in the mid-40s to low-50s range.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value towards the prize is 82 and considering the previous rounds' bidding history, it is wise to place a competitive bid that increases my chances of winning while also aiming to secure a profit. Higher winning bids in previous rounds tended to have second-highest bids closely trailing behind. By bidding 75, I ensure a strong competitive bid that should help win the prize while allowing room for a reasonable profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Past rounds show that winning bids are often close to perceived values, with second-highest bids usually just a few units lower. By bidding 59, I aim to strike a balance between making a competitive bid and ensuring potential profitability if the second-highest bid falls in the low-to-mid 50s range.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids often slightly exceed other competitors' bids, but given the low perceived value, minimizing risk is key. Bidding 5 should provide a balance between being competitive in case others also have low perceived values, and minimizing the downside risk if the second-highest bid significantly undercuts my value.'

In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 70 this round, I need to bid competitively while still ensuring a positive profit margin. From previous rounds, it's evident that the second-highest bid tends to be slightly below the highest bids, which often range from around 50 to 75. By bidding 60, I aim to position myself strongly enough to win while still leaving a reasonable buffer if I end up paying the second-highest bid. This strategy balances competitiveness and profit potential.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is only 13 this round, I should bid conservatively to minimize the risk of paying close to or above my perceived value. In previous rounds, bidding has frequently been high, often above the common value, leading to negative profits. By bidding 5, I stand a small chance of winning if others bid extremely low, but more importantly, this conservative bid minimizes the risk of a significant loss.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 95 for this round, I need to bid high to have a strong chance of winning. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, the highest bids tend to be quite high, frequently exceeding 50 and occasionally approaching 80 or higher. The second-highest bid often falls slightly below the highest bid but is generally in a similar range. By bidding 80, I position myself to win while aiming to leave a substantial margin for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is considerably lower. This approach maximizes my chance of winning the prize with a balance between competitiveness and profit margins.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 80 for this round and learning from the history of previous rounds, I see that winning bids tend to range from mid-50s to mid-70s, with second-highest bids often slightly lower. By bidding 70, I aim to be competitive and have a strong chance of winning while maintaining a reasonable margin of safety to maximize profit based on the common value.

In previous rounds, I observed that bids tend to cluster around the mid to high range and the second-highest bid is often within 5 to 10 units of the highest bid. By bidding 75, I aim to outbid my competitors while still securing a profit if the second-highest bid falls in a similar range as observed before.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 49, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 59, 55, 53, 53, 52, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I'll strategically bid 43. In past rounds, bids tended to cluster slightly below my perceived value. By bidding slightly lower than in previous rounds, I avoid overpaying while still maintaining a competitive bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 32, 27, 22, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 38 this round, I want to strategically place a bid that increases my chances of winning while maintaining a potential profit margin. Observing the previous rounds, the winning bids tend to cluster high, leading to losses when bids are too close to perceived value. By bidding 33, I stay competitive but avoid the risk of overbidding and potentially making a loss due to the second-highest bid being close to my bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive but still cautious given the low value of the prize. Observing the previous rounds, the highest winning bids typically range significantly higher, and the second-highest bid is often close. A bid of 14 minimizes my potential loss while still providing a chance to win if others bid low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, my perceived value of 51 suggests that bidding too high can lead to significant losses due to the common value and second-highest bid. In previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to cluster around 10-15 units of variance from other bids, so bidding around 41 should place me in a competitive position without excessively overbidding, which could help maximize my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize this round, I want to bid in a way that maximizes my chance of winning without overpaying. Reviewing the previous 7 rounds, successful bids clustered around 10-20 units below my perceived value. High bids often resulted in significant losses when the second-highest bid was close to the winning bid. By bidding 55, I strategically place myself in a competitive spot, maximizing my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 77, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 87 for the prize this round, and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, it is apparent that winning bids tend to be fairly high, often clustering close to the perceived value but usually lower. To maximize my chances of winning and securing a profit, I should bid a high but reasonable amount. By bidding 77, I strategically place myself in a competitive position while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the typical high levels observed in previous rounds.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I'm attempting to balance being competitive with avoiding overbidding. Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and considering the bidding patterns observed in the previous rounds, it is crucial to strike a balance between being competitive and not overpaying. By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 63 in this round, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing potential overpayment. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values but slightly lower. By bidding 53, I strategically position myself in the competitive range while leaving room for potential profit even if the second-highest bid is relatively high.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 17 and analyzing the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds, bidding around 14 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 84, past rounds show that high bids often result in close second-highest bids, leading to minimal profit or even losses. Observing the trend, second-highest bids tend to be below the highest bid by a margin of about 5 to 10 units. By bidding 74, I aim to outbid the majority while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid falls in the typical range seen in previous rounds.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68 this round, I need to strategize based on previous rounds where the second-highest bid often fell within 5 to 10 units below the highest bid. Placing a bid of 58 should put me in a competitive position while leaving enough margin to secure a potential profit if the second-highest bid aligns with observed patterns.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Florian. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder David, Bidder Ethel.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 49 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

In previous rounds, the second-highest bids have often been very close to the highest bids (e.g., 65/61, 75/72, 55/54). To maximize my profit, I will emulate these past patterns by bidding 72. This should be competitive enough to win the auction while ensuring a reasonable gap if the second-highest bid is close, thus maximizing my potential profit.'

This balances the high chance of winning the auction with a decent margin above typical highest bids from previous rounds (65, 50, 40).

In previous rounds, highest bids ranged from 40 to 75, with second-highest bids usually around 70-75% of the highest bid. To maximize my chances of winning while not significantly cutting into my profit, I will bid 59.

For example, in previous rounds, bids around 45, 48, and 55 were competitive but not always high enough to secure the win. To maximize my chance of winning this auction while maintaining a good margin for profit, I aim for a bid of 50, which balances competitiveness with minimizing potential loss if I win and have to pay the second-highest bid.'

I will bid 76, which is slightly above the highest observed successful bid, thus balancing the risk of losing with the need for a high bid to secure the win.'

Previous highest bids have ranged from 33 to 85, often with a significant spread in second-highest bids. Bidding 57 aims to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing my potential loss if I end up paying a high second-highest bid. This bid also leaves a reasonable margin for profit based on my perceived value.'

In previous rounds, such as rounds 8 and 10, slightly lower bids were successful. Hence, I aim to balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by bidding 51. This positions me well to potentially win while mitigating high payment risks.'

In previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been close to the perceived values but with a reasonable spread. To maximize my chance of winning while leaving a margin for profit, I will bid 56. This bid is sufficiently competitive while allowing room to benefit if I win and pay the second-highest bid.'

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds where the highest winning bids and second-highest bids varied, I will place a conservative bid. Historically, placing a bid close to my perceived value usually does not lead to a win unless the competition undervalues their bids. By bidding 6, I minimize potential loss while keeping a small chance of winning if others bid lower than expected.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65.

This is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning the prize while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin based on the expected second-highest bid. Moreover, previous rounds indicate that overly aggressive bids often result in lower or negative profits, so a bid of 65 balances competitiveness with profitability.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58.

To balance competitiveness with the potential for profit, I choose to bid 70. This bid is high enough to be competitive based on historical data but leaves some margin for a better profit outcome if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 43. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 45 for this round, I'll leverage historical data. Analyzing recent rounds, bids slightly below the perceived value while being competitive tend to balance risk and reward effectively.

In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, my perceived value of 51 suggests that bidding too high can lead to significant losses due to the common value and second-highest bid. In previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to cluster around 10-15 units of variance from other bids, so bidding around 41 should place me in a competitive position without excessively overbidding, which could help maximize my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize this round, I want to bid in a way that maximizes my chance of winning without overpaying. Reviewing the previous 7 rounds, successful bids clustered around 10-20 units below my perceived value. High bids often resulted in significant losses when the second-highest bid was close to the winning bid. By bidding 55, I strategically place myself in a competitive spot, maximizing my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 77, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 87 for the prize this round, and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, it is apparent that winning bids tend to be fairly high, often clustering close to the perceived value but usually lower. To maximize my chances of winning and securing a profit, I should bid a high but reasonable amount. By bidding 77, I strategically place myself in a competitive position while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the typical high levels observed in previous rounds.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I'm attempting to balance being competitive with avoiding overbidding. Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and considering the bidding patterns observed in the previous rounds, it is crucial to strike a balance between being competitive and not overpaying. By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 63 in this round, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing potential overpayment. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values but slightly lower. By bidding 53, I strategically position myself in the competitive range while leaving room for potential profit even if the second-highest bid is relatively high.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 17 and analyzing the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds, bidding around 14 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 84, past rounds show that high bids often result in close second-highest bids, leading to minimal profit or even losses. Observing the trend, second-highest bids tend to be below the highest bid by a margin of about 5 to 10 units. By bidding 74, I aim to outbid the majority while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid falls in the typical range seen in previous rounds.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68 this round, I need to strategize based on previous rounds where the second-highest bid often fell within 5 to 10 units below the highest bid. Placing a bid of 58 should put me in a competitive position while leaving enough margin to secure a potential profit if the second-highest bid aligns with observed patterns.' In round 16, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 43, 39, 38, 35, 32.

This balances the high chance of winning the auction with a decent margin above typical highest bids from previous rounds (65, 50, 40).

In previous rounds, highest bids ranged from 40 to 75, with second-highest bids usually around 70-75% of the highest bid. To maximize my chances of winning while not significantly cutting into my profit, I will bid 59.

Given that my perceived value is relatively low, bidding 22 gives me a small but potential chance to win if others undervalue the prize while minimizing my potential loss if I don't win.'

Previous rounds indicate that winning bids can vary significantly, but recent winning bids were often higher than 25.

To maximize my chance of winning this auction without excessively risking my profit margin, I aim for a bid of 48. This value is competitive considering patterns in previous rounds and balances the need for winning against the potential risk of overpayment.'

For example, in previous rounds, bids around 45, 48, and 55 were competitive but not always high enough to secure the win. To maximize my chance of winning this auction while maintaining a good margin for profit, I aim for a bid of 50, which balances competitiveness with minimizing potential loss if I win and have to pay the second-highest bid.'

I will bid 76, which is slightly above the highest observed successful bid, thus balancing the risk of losing with the need for a high bid to secure the win.'

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for this round and studying the historical bid patterns, it's evident that placing a bid slightly below my perceived value can be a good strategy. Previous highest bids have ranged from 33 to 85, often with a significant spread in second-highest bids. Bidding 57 aims to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing my potential loss if I end up paying a high second-highest bid. This bid also leaves a reasonable margin for profit based on my perceived value.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 57, you bid 51, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47.

The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 57 for this round and observing the historical patterns where the second-highest bids have generally been close to but not exceeding the highest bids, I want to place a competitive bid without overbidding. In previous rounds, such as rounds 8 and 10, slightly lower bids were successful. Hence, I aim to balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by bidding 51. This positions me well to potentially win while mitigating high payment risks.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60.

In previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been close to the perceived values but with a reasonable spread. To maximize my chance of winning while leaving a margin for profit, I will bid 56. This bid is sufficiently competitive while allowing room to benefit if I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 8, you bid 6, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 8 for this round and analyzing the previous rounds where the highest winning bids and second-highest bids varied, I will place a conservative bid. Historically, placing a bid close to my perceived value usually does not lead to a win unless the competition undervalues their bids. By bidding 6, I minimize potential loss while keeping a small chance of winning if others bid lower than expected.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for this round and considering the historical bidding patterns where the highest bids vary significantly but successful bids often fall in the 50-65 range, I will aim for a bid of 65. This is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning the prize while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin based on the expected second-highest bid. Moreover, previous rounds indicate that overly aggressive bids often result in lower or negative profits, so a bid of 65 balances competitiveness with profitability.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 77, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 77 for this round, and analyzing the previous rounds, I observe that aggressive bidding around 75-85 has often resulted in winning but with smaller profit margins or losses due to high second-highest bids. To balance competitiveness with the potential for profit, I choose to bid 70. This bid is high enough to be competitive based on historical data but leaves some margin for a better profit outcome if I win.' In round 16, Your (perceived) total value was 45, you bid 39, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 43, 39, 38, 35, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 43. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 45 for this round, I'll leverage historical data. Analyzing recent rounds, bids slightly below the perceived value while being competitive tend to balance risk and reward effectively. I notice that winning bids often hover within a range lower than the perceived maximum value, and providing a bid of 39 places me reasonably close to expected winning bids while retaining a cushion for profit.' In round 17, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -22. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 37, 30, 28, 28, 28.

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9 and analyzing the previous rounds, it is evident that winning bids often exceed the second-highest bid by a small margin, causing some winners to take a loss. Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.'

To strategically place a competitive bid and maximize my chances of winning while minimizing the likelihood of overpaying, I will bid 53. This approach should balance between securing the prize and achieving potential profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls in the mid-40s to low-50s range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value towards the prize is 82 and considering the previous rounds' bidding history, it is wise to place a competitive bid that increases my chances of winning while also aiming to secure a profit. Higher winning bids in previous rounds tended to have second-highest bids closely trailing behind. By bidding 75, I ensure a strong competitive bid that should help win the prize while allowing room for a reasonable profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Typically, second-highest bids are in the mid to high 50s when perceived values are in the range of 60s. By bidding 57, I aim to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of securing the prize while leaving room for profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls around the mid-50s range.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids often slightly exceed other competitors' bids, but given the low perceived value, minimizing risk is key. Bidding 5 should provide a balance between being competitive in case others also have low perceived values, and minimizing the downside risk if the second-highest bid significantly undercuts my value.'

In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 32, 27, 22, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 38 this round, I want to strategically place a bid that increases my chances of winning while maintaining a potential profit margin. Observing the previous rounds, the winning bids tend to cluster high, leading to losses when bids are too close to perceived value. By bidding 33, I stay competitive but avoid the risk of overbidding and potentially making a loss due to the second-highest bid being close to my bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive but still cautious given the low value of the prize. Observing the previous rounds, the highest winning bids typically range significantly higher, and the second-highest bid is often close. A bid of 14 minimizes my potential loss while still providing a chance to win if others bid low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, my perceived value of 51 suggests that bidding too high can lead to significant losses due to the common value and second-highest bid. In previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to cluster around 10-15 units of variance from other bids, so bidding around 41 should place me in a competitive position without excessively overbidding, which could help maximize my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize this round, I want to bid in a way that maximizes my chance of winning without overpaying. Reviewing the previous 7 rounds, successful bids clustered around 10-20 units below my perceived value. High bids often resulted in significant losses when the second-highest bid was close to the winning bid. By bidding 55, I strategically place myself in a competitive spot, maximizing my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 77, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 87 for the prize this round, and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, it is apparent that winning bids tend to be fairly high, often clustering close to the perceived value but usually lower. To maximize my chances of winning and securing a profit, I should bid a high but reasonable amount. By bidding 77, I strategically place myself in a competitive position while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the typical high levels observed in previous rounds.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I'm attempting to balance being competitive with avoiding overbidding. Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and considering the bidding patterns observed in the previous rounds, it is crucial to strike a balance between being competitive and not overpaying. By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 63 in this round, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing potential overpayment. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values but slightly lower. By bidding 53, I strategically position myself in the competitive range while leaving room for potential profit even if the second-highest bid is relatively high.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 17 and analyzing the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds, bidding around 14 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 84, past rounds show that high bids often result in close second-highest bids, leading to minimal profit or even losses. Observing the trend, second-highest bids tend to be below the highest bid by a margin of about 5 to 10 units. By bidding 74, I aim to outbid the majority while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid falls in the typical range seen in previous rounds.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68 this round, I need to strategize based on previous rounds where the second-highest bid often fell within 5 to 10 units below the highest bid. Placing a bid of 58 should put me in a competitive position while leaving enough margin to secure a potential profit if the second-highest bid aligns with observed patterns.' In round 16, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 43, 39, 38, 35, 32.

For example, in previous rounds, bids around 45, 48, and 55 were competitive but not always high enough to secure the win.

Previous highest bids have ranged from 33 to 85, often with a significant spread in second-highest bids. Bidding 57 aims to strike a balance between being competitive enough to potentially win while minimizing my potential loss if I end up paying a high second-highest bid. This bid also leaves a reasonable margin for profit based on my perceived value.'

In previous rounds, such as rounds 8 and 10, slightly lower bids were successful. Hence, I aim to balance between being competitive and maximizing potential profit by bidding 51. This positions me well to potentially win while mitigating high payment risks.'

In previous rounds, the highest bids have generally been close to the perceived values but with a reasonable spread. To maximize my chance of winning while leaving a margin for profit, I will bid 56.

Historically, placing a bid close to my perceived value usually does not lead to a win unless the competition undervalues their bids. By bidding 6, I minimize potential loss while keeping a small chance of winning if others bid lower than expected.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 75, you bid 65, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -15. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 75 for this round and considering the historical bidding patterns where the highest bids vary significantly but successful bids often fall in the 50-65 range, I will aim for a bid of 65. This is competitive enough to have a high chance of winning the prize while leaving room for a reasonable profit margin based on the expected second-highest bid. Moreover, previous rounds indicate that overly aggressive bids often result in lower or negative profits, so a bid of 65 balances competitiveness with profitability.'

To balance competitiveness with the potential for profit, I choose to bid 70. This bid is high enough to be competitive based on historical data but leaves some margin for a better profit outcome if I win.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 43. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 45 for this round, I'll leverage historical data. Analyzing recent rounds, bids slightly below the perceived value while being competitive tend to balance risk and reward effectively. I notice that winning bids often hover within a range lower than the perceived maximum value, and providing a bid of 39 places me reasonably close to expected winning bids while retaining a cushion for profit.' In round 17, Your (perceived) total value was 48, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -22. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 37, 30, 28, 28, 28.

The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value for the prize is 67, I want to maximize my profit while placing a competitive bid. In the last rounds, the winning bids were 40 and 50, with second-highest bids being 30 and 45, respectively. Bidding 61 should give me a strong chance of winning the prize while ensuring I do not overpay significantly, allowing for a potential profit even if the second-highest bid is slightly lower.'

The second-highest bids have varied around 30, 45, and 61. With my value for the prize at 78, I want to place a competitive bid to secure the prize while considering profitability. Bidding 71 should give me a strong chance of winning without overpaying too much, allowing for potential profit, especially if the second-highest bid is around 60-65.'

The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 58, and considering the bidding history, bids generally range higher when higher-perceived values are presented. Bidding 53 offers a strategically sound and competitive bid to outdo others, while allowing some room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the high 40s or low 50s, reflecting patterns from previous rounds.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Considering my perceived value for the prize is 30 and analyzing previous rounds, bids tend to be competitive and often result in small profits or even losses for the winners. To strike a balance between a competitive bid and the risk of overpaying, I will bid slightly below my perceived value. This allows me to potentially win the prize without significantly overpaying, hence preserving or even improving my total profit. Bidding 27 should offer a reasonable chance of winning while minimizing the risk of a significant loss.'

The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 9 and analyzing the previous rounds, it is evident that winning bids often exceed the second-highest bid by a small margin, causing some winners to take a loss. Considering the low value in this round and to maximize my total profit, a conservatively low bid of 7 should give me a reasonable chance of winning without risking a significant loss, especially since higher bids could result in overbidding compared to the perceived value.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value for the prize is 58, and considering the historical bidding patterns, bids typically range in the mid to high 50s or low 60s when values are high. To strategically place a competitive bid and maximize my chances of winning while minimizing the likelihood of overpaying, I will bid 53. This approach should balance between securing the prize and achieving potential profit, assuming the second-highest bid falls in the mid-40s to low-50s range.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my perceived value towards the prize is 82 and considering the previous rounds' bidding history, it is wise to place a competitive bid that increases my chances of winning while also aiming to secure a profit. Higher winning bids in previous rounds tended to have second-highest bids closely trailing behind. By bidding 75, I ensure a strong competitive bid that should help win the prize while allowing room for a reasonable profit depending on the second-highest bid.'

Past rounds show that winning bids are often close to perceived values, with second-highest bids usually just a few units lower. By bidding 59, I aim to strike a balance between making a competitive bid and ensuring potential profitability if the second-highest bid falls in the low-to-mid 50s range.'

From previous rounds, it's evident that winning bids often slightly exceed other competitors' bids, but given the low perceived value, minimizing risk is key. Bidding 5 should provide a balance between being competitive in case others also have low perceived values, and minimizing the downside risk if the second-highest bid significantly undercuts my value.'

In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 70 this round, I need to bid competitively while still ensuring a positive profit margin. From previous rounds, it's evident that the second-highest bid tends to be slightly below the highest bids, which often range from around 50 to 75. By bidding 60, I aim to position myself strongly enough to win while still leaving a reasonable buffer if I end up paying the second-highest bid. This strategy balances competitiveness and profit potential.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 13, you bid 5, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -21. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value towards the prize is only 13 this round, I should bid conservatively to minimize the risk of paying close to or above my perceived value. In previous rounds, bidding has frequently been high, often above the common value, leading to negative profits. By bidding 5, I stand a small chance of winning if others bid extremely low, but more importantly, this conservative bid minimizes the risk of a significant loss.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 95, you bid 80, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -3.\\nYour total profit is -24. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 95 for this round, I need to bid high to have a strong chance of winning. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, the highest bids tend to be quite high, frequently exceeding 50 and occasionally approaching 80 or higher. The second-highest bid often falls slightly below the highest bid but is generally in a similar range. By bidding 80, I position myself to win while aiming to leave a substantial margin for a positive profit if the second-highest bid is considerably lower. This approach maximizes my chance of winning the prize with a balance between competitiveness and profit margins.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 70, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -7.\\nYour total profit is -31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 80 for this round and learning from the history of previous rounds, I see that winning bids tend to range from mid-50s to mid-70s, with second-highest bids often slightly lower. By bidding 70, I aim to be competitive and have a strong chance of winning while maintaining a reasonable margin of safety to maximize profit based on the common value. This approach balances the risk of overbidding and ensures potential positive profit.' In round 16, Your (perceived) total value was 42, you bid 35, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 43, 39, 38, 35, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 43. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize this round is 42, I want to bid high enough to have a competitive chance of winning but conservatively enough to minimize the risk of overbidding. Analyzing the bidding patterns from previous rounds, winning bids frequently range from the mid-40s to mid-70s, with second-highest bids usually slightly lower. By bidding 35, I aim to balance competitiveness and profit potential, ensuring a reasonable margin if I win.' In round 17, Your (perceived) total value was 36, you bid 28, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 37, 30, 28, 28, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 41 and paid 37. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 36 for this round, and analyzing the history of previous rounds, bids have often been quite competitive with winning bids generally ranging from the mid-40s to mid-70s. However, due to my current negative total profit, I need to balance competitiveness with caution. By bidding 28, I seek to maintain a competitive edge while ensuring a good profit margin if I win. This bid is strategically lower than my value to minimize the risk of overbidding compared to others' likely bids.' In round 18, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 10, the (true) common value of the prize was 16, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 25, 19, 18, 14, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and paid 25. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize this round is 17 and learning from previous rounds where the highest bids tend to be significantly higher than my current perceived value, I aim to bid conservatively to minimize the risk of a loss. Past rounds show low perceived value bids winning occasionally but often result in minimal or negative profit due to high second-highest bids. By bidding 10, I position myself with a chance to win if others bid unusually low while mitigating the risk of overpaying compared to my perceived value.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder David. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles, Bidder Ethel, Bidder Florian.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 95 in this round.\n            Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 40 and paid 30. The winner's profit was -4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 45, I want to bid slightly below that to ensure that I potentially win the auction without overpaying. By bidding 40, I leave room to profit even if the second-highest bid is close to my bid, maximizing my net gain.' In round 1, Your (perceived) total value was 52, you bid 45, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 45, 45, 45, 35. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 52, I want to place a strategic bid that is high enough to have a good chance of winning but still allows for a potential profit margin. In the previous round, the highest bid was 40, and the second-highest bid was 30, so I'll bid 45 to maximize my chances of winning without excessively overbidding.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 70, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -4. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 61, 60, 55, 49, 45. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 61. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 70, I want to make sure I place a bid that maximizes my chance of winning while still ensuring a good profit margin. In previous rounds, the highest bids were 40 and 50, with second-highest bids being slightly lower. By bidding 60, I am increasing my chances of winning while attempting to avoid overpaying significantly.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 80, you bid 75, the (true) common value of the prize was 62, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -10.\\nYour total profit is -14. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 72, 71, 68, 65, 50. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and paid 72. The winner's profit was -10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 80 for the prize this round, I want to bid high enough to have a strong chance of winning while ensuring a significant profit margin. In previous rounds, I observed that bids tend to cluster around the mid to high range and the second-highest bid is often within 5 to 10 units of the highest bid. By bidding 75, I aim to outbid my competitors while still securing a profit if the second-highest bid falls in a similar range as observed before.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 59 and paid 55. The winner's profit was -6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 52 for this round, I'll strategically bid 43. In past rounds, bids tended to cluster slightly below my perceived value. By bidding slightly lower than in previous rounds, I avoid overpaying while still maintaining a competitive bid.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 38, you bid 33, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -12.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 33, 32, 27, 22, 20, 20. The highest bidder won with a bid of 33 and paid 32. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 38 this round, I want to strategically place a bid that increases my chances of winning while maintaining a potential profit margin. Observing the previous rounds, the winning bids tend to cluster high, leading to losses when bids are too close to perceived value. By bidding 33, I stay competitive but avoid the risk of overbidding and potentially making a loss due to the second-highest bid being close to my bid.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 16, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 8, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 5, 21, 20, 16, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 16 this round, I want to place a bid that is competitive but still cautious given the low value of the prize. Observing the previous rounds, the highest winning bids typically range significantly higher, and the second-highest bid is often close. A bid of 14 minimizes my potential loss while still providing a chance to win if others bid low.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 51, you bid 41, the (true) common value of the prize was 43, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -26. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 48, 44, 41, 35, 34. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 48. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on previous rounds, my perceived value of 51 suggests that bidding too high can lead to significant losses due to the common value and second-highest bid. In previous rounds, I've observed that bids tend to cluster around 10-15 units of variance from other bids, so bidding around 41 should place me in a competitive position without excessively overbidding, which could help maximize my potential profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 64, you bid 55, the (true) common value of the prize was 53, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was -1.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 50, 50, 48, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was -1.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 64 for the prize this round, I want to bid in a way that maximizes my chance of winning without overpaying. Reviewing the previous 7 rounds, successful bids clustered around 10-20 units below my perceived value. High bids often resulted in significant losses when the second-highest bid was close to the winning bid. By bidding 55, I strategically place myself in a competitive spot, maximizing my potential profit while minimizing the risk of overpaying if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 87, you bid 77, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 77, 76, 75, 75, 72. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 77. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 87 for the prize this round, and considering the bidding patterns from previous rounds, it is apparent that winning bids tend to be fairly high, often clustering close to the perceived value but usually lower. To maximize my chances of winning and securing a profit, I should bid a high but reasonable amount. By bidding 77, I strategically place myself in a competitive position while leaving room for profit if the second-highest bid is around the typical high levels observed in previous rounds.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 56, you bid 48, the (true) common value of the prize was 48, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 57, 51, 50, 49, 48. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 57. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 56, I'm attempting to balance being competitive with avoiding overbidding. Observing previous rounds, the highest bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values, but often lead to low or negative profits due to high second-highest bids. Therefore, by bidding 48, I strategically place myself in a competitive range while still leaving room for potential profit if the second-highest bid falls within the typical range observed in earlier rounds.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 60, you bid 50, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 59, 55, 51, 50, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and paid 59. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 60 and considering the bidding patterns observed in the previous rounds, it is crucial to strike a balance between being competitive and not overpaying. By bidding 50, I increase my chances of winning while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid is lower. Previous rounds indicate that bids tend to cluster around 10-20 units below perceived values, so a bid of 50 should align well with this pattern.' In round 12, Your (perceived) total value was 63, you bid 53, the (true) common value of the prize was 52, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 60, 57, 56, 56, 53. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 60. The winner's profit was -8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 63 in this round, I want to place a competitive bid that maximizes my chances of winning while minimizing potential overpayment. Reviewing the history of previous rounds, winning bids tend to cluster close to the perceived values but slightly lower. By bidding 53, I strategically position myself in the competitive range while leaving room for potential profit even if the second-highest bid is relatively high.' In round 13, Your (perceived) total value was 17, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 5, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 6, 5, 5, 14, 14, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 6 and paid 5. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my current value of 17 and analyzing the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds, bidding around 14 allows me to stay competitive while minimizing the risk of overpaying. Observations show that second-highest bids tend to fall close to winning bids but usually below. By bidding 14, I align with the cautious approach seen in rounds with lower perceived values, reducing potential losses.' In round 14, Your (perceived) total value was 84, you bid 74, the (true) common value of the prize was 75, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 80, 78, 77, 74, 67, 65. The highest bidder won with a bid of 80 and paid 78. The winner's profit was -3.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Based on my perceived value of 84, past rounds show that high bids often result in close second-highest bids, leading to minimal profit or even losses. Observing the trend, second-highest bids tend to be below the highest bid by a margin of about 5 to 10 units. By bidding 74, I aim to outbid the majority while leaving a reasonable margin to secure a profit if the second-highest bid falls in the typical range seen in previous rounds.' In round 15, Your (perceived) total value was 68, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 63, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 70, 62, 59, 59, 58. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and paid 70. The winner's profit was -7.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 68 this round, I need to strategize based on previous rounds where the second-highest bid often fell within 5 to 10 units below the highest bid. Placing a bid of 58 should put me in a competitive position while leaving enough margin to secure a potential profit if the second-highest bid aligns with observed patterns.' In round 16, Your (perceived) total value was 49, you bid 43, the (true) common value of the prize was 40, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 43, 39, 38, 35, 32.

To maximize my total profit while minimizing the risk of overbidding, I will bid 43, placing myself in a competitive position while leaving room for a potential profit if the second-highest bid aligns with the observed pattern.' In round 17, Your (perceived) total value was 43, you bid 37, the (true) common value of the prize was 30, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -27. \\nAll the bids for this round were 41, 37, 30, 28, 28, 28.
