For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 0 and 79. Every number between 0 and 79 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and 20. Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value. However, at the start of each round, you will learn only your total value for the prize, not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different perceived value for the prize. \nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your (perceived) value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 0 and 99, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.

Assuming the competition could value the prize differently, a safe strategy would be to bid around half my value as a compromise between winning the prize and not overpaying. Therefore, I bid 9 hoping to win at a reasonable second-highest bid.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 42 and paid 38. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'To maximize my profit, I should consider placing a bid that is a balance between winning the prize and the payment based on the second-highest bid. Given my value for the prize is 44, bidding around halfway (22) is a strategic move. This allows me to outbid competitors potentially without overpaying, since the payment will be the second-highest bid and my private adjustment might not be too far off from theirs.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I want to bid in a way that increases my chance of winning while maximizing my profit. Bidding roughly half my perceived value (14) is a strategic move to potentially outbid the others without overpaying significantly, as the payment will be the second-highest bid and it's likely competitors' adjustments fall within the 0-20 range.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, my strategy is to bid around half my perceived value to balance the risk of overpaying and the chance of winning. By bidding 20, I am attempting to outbid competitors while ensuring the payment (second-highest bid) doesn't excessively reduce my profit if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 50, a strategic approach would be to bid around half of that value, which is 25. This helps balance the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying, considering that the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid. This approach is consistent with my previous bidding strategies.'

In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I want to bid in a way that increases my chance of winning while maximizing my profit. Bidding roughly half my perceived value (14) is a strategic move to potentially outbid the others without overpaying significantly, as the payment will be the second-highest bid and it's likely competitors' adjustments fall within the 0-20 range.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 20, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, my strategy is to bid around half my perceived value to balance the risk of overpaying and the chance of winning. By bidding 20, I am attempting to outbid competitors while ensuring the payment (second-highest bid) doesn't excessively reduce my profit if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 50, a strategic approach would be to bid around half of that value, which is 25. This helps balance the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying, considering that the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid. This approach is consistent with my previous bidding strategies.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 28. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 44, bidding around half my perceived value (22) helps balance the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the payment (second-highest bid) in check. Previous rounds show this approach has kept my profit stable without significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 29, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 29. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 30, bidding around half my value (15) helps balance the chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This strategy is consistent with my previous approach and aims to optimize potential profit by ensuring the payment, which is the second-highest bid, doesn't negate the value of the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 18, 16. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for the prize, I strategically bid around half my perceived value (which is 7) to balance the chance of winning with the risk of overpaying. Considering the common value and others' private adjustments could vary widely, this amount is optimal to potentially win without significantly cutting into the profit.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 65 in this round.\n            You need to maximize your total profit.

Assuming the competition could value the prize differently, a safe strategy would be to bid around half my value as a compromise between winning the prize and not overpaying. Therefore, I bid 9 hoping to win at a reasonable second-highest bid.'

Given my value for the prize is 44, bidding around halfway (22) is a strategic move. This allows me to outbid competitors potentially without overpaying, since the payment will be the second-highest bid and my private adjustment might not be too far off from theirs.'

The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I want to bid in a way that increases my chance of winning while maximizing my profit. Bidding roughly half my perceived value (14) is a strategic move to potentially outbid the others without overpaying significantly, as the payment will be the second-highest bid and it's likely competitors' adjustments fall within the 0-20 range.'

This helps balance the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying, considering that the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid. This approach is consistent with my previous bidding strategies.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 34, I want to bid considerably below that value but still high enough to have a good chance to win. By bidding 25, I leave a margin for profit if I win while maintaining competitiveness. This bid takes into account previous rounds' bids as well.'

The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 46, but to maximize my total profit, I want to bid below that value to ensure a margin for profit if I win. Based on previous rounds where bids were relatively competitive, a bid of 35 positions me favorably to win while leaving adequate room for profit.'

To maximize total profit, I will bid significantly below my value to ensure a profit if I win, while keeping the bid competitive based on historical bid patterns. A bid of 29 leaves an adequate margin for profit and reflects previous rounds where the winning bids were relatively high.'

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 59, I'd aim to bid close to my perceived value minus an estimated margin for the second-highest bid to ensure a balance between winning the prize and maximizing profit. Bidding 42 allows a competitive bid while maintaining a comfortable margin for a potential profit.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 29, I'd aim to bid moderately lower to ensure a balance between a competitive bid and profit maximization. Assuming the other bidders may undervalue slightly, a bid of 19 allows for a reasonable chance to win without overpaying, optimizing my potential profit margin.'

The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 20 towards the prize, I want to ensure that my bid is competitive but also leaves room for potential profit. Bidder behavior from previous rounds suggests winning bids often slightly exceed moderate values. Bidding 13 balances competitiveness with minimizing the risk of overpaying based on potential second-highest bids.'

Based on previous rounds, winning bids and second-highest bids have often been in the mid-to-high range. Bidding 35 should provide a reasonable chance to win while avoiding overbidding, maintaining a good profit margin.'

Previous rounds show that second-highest bids range from mid to high values within 10 to 20 range of the highest bid. By bidding 18, I maintain a reasonable chance of winning without overpaying, thus optimizing my potential profit margin.'

The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 62 for this round, I would aim to bid slightly below my value to provide a significant margin for profit in case I win the auction. Historical data shows that the second-highest bid often falls in the mid-to-high range. Therefore, bidding 48 ensures a competitive bid while allowing a reasonable profit margin, assuming I win and pay the second-highest bid.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 81, you bid 58, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 36. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my perceived value of 81 for this round, I aim to bid strategically to maximize total profit. To stay competitive yet ensure a significant profit margin, I'll bid slightly below my perceived value. Observing past rounds, second-highest bids have often been 10-15 points below high bids. Therefore, bidding 58 should ensure a competitive bid, maintaining a healthy margin for profit.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 82, you bid 60, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 12.\\nYour total profit is 12. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 60, 40.

Given my value for the prize is 44, bidding around halfway (22) is a strategic move. This allows me to outbid competitors potentially without overpaying, since the payment will be the second-highest bid and my private adjustment might not be too far off from theirs.' In round 2, Your (perceived) total value was 29, you bid 14, the (true) common value of the prize was 10, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 19, 15, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 19 and paid 15. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 29, I want to bid in a way that increases my chance of winning while maximizing my profit. Bidding roughly half my perceived value (14) is a strategic move to potentially outbid the others without overpaying significantly, as the payment will be the second-highest bid and it's likely competitors' adjustments fall within the 0-20 range.' In round 3, Your (perceived) total value was 40, you bid 20, the (true) common value of the prize was 20, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 25, 20, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 25 and paid 20. The winner's profit was 0.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 40, my strategy is to bid around half my perceived value to balance the risk of overpaying and the chance of winning. By bidding 20, I am attempting to outbid competitors while ensuring the payment (second-highest bid) doesn't excessively reduce my profit if I win.' In round 4, Your (perceived) total value was 50, you bid 25, the (true) common value of the prize was 34, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 25, 25. The highest bidder won with a bid of 35 and paid 25. The winner's profit was 9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 50, a strategic approach would be to bid around half of that value, which is 25. This helps balance the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying, considering that the highest bidder wins and pays the second-highest bid. This approach is consistent with my previous bidding strategies.' In round 5, Your (perceived) total value was 44, you bid 22, the (true) common value of the prize was 28, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 35, 28, 22.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the payment (second-highest bid) in check. Previous rounds show this approach has kept my profit stable without significant losses.' In round 6, Your (perceived) total value was 30, you bid 15, the (true) common value of the prize was 24, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 30, 29, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 30 and paid 29. The winner's profit was -5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 30, bidding around half my value (15) helps balance the chance of winning while minimizing the risk of overpaying. This strategy is consistent with my previous approach and aims to optimize potential profit by ensuring the payment, which is the second-highest bid, doesn't negate the value of the prize.' In round 7, Your (perceived) total value was 15, you bid 7, the (true) common value of the prize was 7, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 7, 18, 16. The highest bidder won with a bid of 7 and paid 18. The winner's profit was -9.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for the prize, I strategically bid around half my perceived value (which is 7) to balance the chance of winning with the risk of overpaying. Considering the common value and others' private adjustments could vary widely, this amount is optimal to potentially win without significantly cutting into the profit.' In round 8, Your (perceived) total value was 65, you bid 32, the (true) common value of the prize was 51, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 48, 37, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 48 and paid 37.

This approach aims to balance the chance of winning with the risk of overpaying, considering I'll pay the second-highest bid if I win. Therefore, bidding 32 allows me to potentially secure the prize without significantly reducing my profit.' In round 9, Your (perceived) total value was 72, you bid 36, the (true) common value of the prize was 70, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 36.

This strategy balances the potential benefit of winning with the risk of overpaying. By bidding 36, I aim to increase my chances of winning while ensuring the second-highest bid doesn't significantly reduce my profit if I win.' In round 10, Your (perceived) total value was 79, you bid 40, the (true) common value of the prize was 72, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 60, 40.

The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is 79, I want to maximize my total profit by balancing my bid between winning the prize and not overpaying. Bidding around half my perceived value (which is 40) has been a consistent strategy to potentially win without reducing the profit significantly. Since I will pay the second-highest bid if I win, this approach helps ensure I do not overpay while keeping a competitive bid.' In round 11, Your (perceived) total value was 9, you bid 4, the (true) common value of the prize was 3, and your profit (based on the true value of the prize) was 0.\\nYour total profit is -5. \\nAll the bids for this round were 5, 4, 10.
