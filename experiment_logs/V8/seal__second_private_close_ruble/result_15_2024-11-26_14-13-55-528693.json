But, if others bid the same or more, I lose with no regrets as I couldn't have predicted their bids.\n\nIf I bid lower than my value, I win if others bid less than it, and it's a profitable outcome.

If multiple people bid the same, chances of winning decrease. There may be slight regrets as I will not gain any profit from this round, but I also don't lose anything.\n\nBidding lower than my value will make me win when it\u2019s the highest bid.
