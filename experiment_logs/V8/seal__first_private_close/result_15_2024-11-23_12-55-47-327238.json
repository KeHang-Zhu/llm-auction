            "Bidder Andy's Plan: \nStarting with a conservative bidding) strategy (around 45% of known value) to establish a general trend. Record and analyze winnings and losses. Then, switch to aggressive strategy (Increase bid to 60-70% of known value) to gauge the increase/decrease in profit. Compare the data from both strategies and assess which had higher returns. If neither is profitable, consider a moderate bidding strategy (50-55% of known value). Also, factor in multiple consecutive losses or wins, potentially pointing to behavioral patterns from competitors. Key priority is diversification of strategies to maximize understanding of the auction dynamics and enhance future profitability. Please be aware, strategy will evolve based on performance and competitor behavior.",
            "Indeed, the decision to bid is multifaceted and requires attention to various scenarios. If I bid high and others bid low, I do invest more, but the long-term gain of understanding the other bidders' approaches outweighs regret. If I bid low and others bid high, losing the bid is an affordable method of acquiring information about their aggressive bidding tendencies. Information is key.\n\nMy bid is $35, a fair initial value to balance risk and reward.\n\nFor future strategies, I aim to:\n\n1. Test the waters with low bids around $20 to assess opponents' response.\n2. Incrementally increase the bid each round to see the cutoff where opponents back out.\n3. Experiment with random high bids to gauge the frequency of aggressive bidding from opponents.",
            "As Bidder Charles, my first strategy would be exploratory, placing bids across a wide spectrum of the bidding range to gather data on the bidding patterns of Andy and Betty. This might involve fluctuating from low, to medium, to high bids from round to round, sometimes bidding closer to my prize value or even higher if it seems advantageous. \n\nIf others bid way lower, I would not regret my bid, because the goal is data gathering and maximizing long-term profit. The same if others bid way higher. It's a learning process. \n\nConsidering all factors, I submit a $50 bid this round."
