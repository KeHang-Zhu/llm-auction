However, the goal is also to gather data on the bidding patterns of the others, which will aid in creating an effective strategy. \n\n2. If others bid way higher: No regret, this would be valuable data indicating a potential aggressive bidding behavior among competitors. This information is useful for future rounds. \n\nFuture strategies to test: \nA. Lower bids ($10-$25) in following rounds to observe shifts in opponent's bidding strategies. \nB. High-risk strategy with near maximum bids (~$90-$99) to test opponents' responses to aggressive bidding.\nC. Random bid values to introduce unpredictability, thereby making it harder for competitors to anticipate my bidding patterns.",

To decide on the final bid, I will weigh the value of the item, the round history, and possible tactics from other bidders. \n\nIf others bid way lower than me, I shouldn't regret my bid. Sure, I may have overpaid, but I still make a profit. If others bid higher, it means I've lost but kept my cash, an acceptable outcome.\n\nMy final bid is $42, taking a moderate approach.\n\nFor future strategies, I plan to:\n\n1. Experiment with low bids ($10-20) to observe competition behaviour.\n2. Try aggressive high bids ($80-90) for potentially high-valued items.\n3. Test bids around the mid-value ($40-60) for a balanced approach.\n4. Factor in competitors' average bids and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n5. Utilize round histories for strategy modifications.",

My initial bid will be half of my prize value, this strategy allows me to potentially make profits whilst also testing the waters. Depending on the game progression, I will adjust my bids accordingly, either increasing or reducing my bid amounts.\n\nIn the event where other bidders bid way lower, I won't necessarily regret my bid because my strategy is future-oriented, aimed at learning and maximizing long-term profits. Similarly, even if the other bidders bid way higher, there's no regret because I'm risk-averse. My final bid for this round is $50."
