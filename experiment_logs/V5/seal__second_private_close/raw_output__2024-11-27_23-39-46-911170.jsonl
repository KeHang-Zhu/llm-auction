Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders.\nAt the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and $99, with all values equally likely.\nAfter learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.\nThe highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings the highest of your opponents bids. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nBefore returning your bid, think through several different candidate bids. \nIf your bid is higher than your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?\nIf your bid is equal to your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?\nIf your bid is lower than your value, when do you win?

The winner's profit was 36.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my history of conservative bidding, a bid of 55 on a value of 72 is aimed to increase competitiveness. It's a moderate approach to probe opponent behavior further, exploring the possibility of encountering conservative rivals or outpacing Charles' observed aggressive strategies, while allowing room for profitable margins if I win. This moderate bid is a step towards more aggressive bidding, learning patterns, maximizing future profits, and is a balance between risk and prudence as I aim for a data-driven long-term strategy.'

The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 98, which is quite high, a bid of 87 is an aggressive strategy aimed to potentially win by outbidding Charles, who has shown a pattern of aggressive bidding. This bid remains below my value to guarantee a healthy profit margin of 11 if successful. It balances the aggressive stance needed to discourage Charles while retaining profitability, should I win. This strategic bid also gathers data on opponents' reactions to high bids, aligning with the long-term goal of maximizing profit through varied strategies.'

The goal is to potentially win the prize at a profitable price, assuming that both Betty and Charles might not bid excessively high given the lower bids they've placed in previous rounds.

This bid is slightly below my assigned value, aligning with a strategy that could secure a win if Andy and Betty bid cautiously. It also preserves some profit margin, minimizing losses if I win. This approach reflects a balance of competitiveness and fiscal caution, considering past rounds where opponents might overbid or underbid in mid-range value situations.'

This bid is slightly below my value, allowing a margin to ensure profit if I win.

The winner's profit was 43.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# In previous rounds, aggressive bidding allowed for a high chance of winning while preventing too much loss if unsuccessful. This time, my value is 97, so I will place an aggressive bid of 67. It\u2019s a test to see if historically close bids to this value are successful.

In round 4, Your value was 60, you bid 37, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 66. \\nAll the bids for this round were 88, 55, 37. The highest bidder won with a bid of 88 and paid 55. The winner's profit was 36.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# By bidding 37, slightly lower than my value of 60, I aim for a strategy that balances competitiveness while minimizing the cost if won. This approach reflects on past trends, where bids closest to the mid-range proved successful and enables me to gather more data on Andy\u2019s and Charles\u2019s bidding behaviors while ensuring a potential profit margin if I win.'

This approach tests moderate aggression while trying to gather insights on my opponents' bidding patterns. Based on prior rounds, this is a balance between minimizing risk and attempting for profit if I win, while keeping the bid safely under my value to ensure a positive outcome.' In round 11, Your value was 87, you bid 68, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 185. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 68, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 68.

The winner's profit was 28.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 80, I aim for a bid of 55 to balance competitiveness with caution. This amount is strategic as it\u2019s aggressive enough to potentially secure a win while observing previous patterns of high bids by Betty and Charles.

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 39, bidding 33 aims to strategically undercut overly aggressive bids while still being competitive enough to win if Betty and Charles bid lower than expected. It is a calculated risk that leaves room for potential profit, considering I've observed certain patterns in their bidding behavior that suggest room for moderate aggression without exceeding my value.' In round 8, Your value was 79, you bid 53, and your profit was 36.\\nYour total profit is 36. \\nAll the bids for this round were 53, 43, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 53 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 36.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 79, I'll bid 53 since it maintains a balance between potential profit and a competitive edge. Recent trends have shown that rivals tend to opt for moderate to high strategies, and a bid of 53 allows me to possibly secure a win without overshooting my value, therefore maximizing potential profit. This bid also aligns with data-gathering strategies to explore the dynamics of Betty's and Charles' current bidding behavior.' In round 9, Your value was 44, you bid 39, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 36. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 42, 39. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 44, bidding 39 allows for a strategic chance to win without exceeding my value and risking a loss. It balances competitiveness and data collection, considering past trends where bets by opponents were moderate to high. This bid gathers insights into the potentially evolving strategies of Betty and Charles, maximizing my chances for long-term profitability.'

The winner's profit was 75.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 26, bidding 21 is strategic as it leaves room for profit if I win and protects against negative outcomes if bids don't align favorably. It allows for exploration of opponent strategies while staying competitive and below my value.' In round 11, Your value was 56, you bid 45, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 36. \\nAll the bids for this round were 72, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 72 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 56, bidding 45 balances being competitive and potentially profitable based on bidding patterns.

This choice is aggressive enough to take advantage of the knowledge that my value is high but still leaves a cushion compared to my valuation to potentially secure a reasonable profit if I win. This also allows exploration of Andy's and Charles' possible tendency for higher bids in a scenario where my value is significantly better.' In round 2, Your value was 96, you bid 68, and your profit was 51.\\nYour total profit is 51. \\nAll the bids for this round were 68, 45, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 68 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 51.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With my value being 96, I'll bid 68. This bid is aggressive but still leaves a significant margin below my valuation, allowing potential profit if I win.

The winner's profit was 23.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With the prize value at 46, I decide to bid the full value. This choice increases the chances of winning in case Andy or Charles bid slightly lower and is based on the observation that bidding aggressively has proven successful previously when matched with similar-value scenarios. This also tests if conservative bids from others could allow me to win without overpaying.'

This is a conservative bid relative to my valuation, aiming to secure a profit by paying less if I win.

Based on past rounds, where I've seen some tendency for high bids by opponents, this bid remains aggressive to win while trying to pay significantly less than my value, balancing the risk.

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With my value for the prize at 23, I'll bid 10. This bid is low relative to my value, reflecting a conservative strategy to minimize possible loss when the value isn't high. I want to learn how high Andy and Charles are willing to bid in this low valuation setting, so that I can gauge their strategies for future rounds.

The winner's profit was 14.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 46, I'm placing a bid of 42. This strategic choice aims to remain competitive by bidding slightly under my value, allowing a potential profit margin if successful. Given the opponents' tendency for higher bids in previous rounds, this still tests their upper limit in a less risky way while capturing insights for optimizing future bids.'

Placing a zero bid in this scenario helps avoid losses and allows observation of the bidding behaviors of my competitors for better decision-making in future rounds where my value might be higher.'

In round 1, Your value was 23, you bid 10, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 10, 5. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 10. The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 23, I aim to bid conservatively at 10 to avoid overcommitting in a scenario where the likelihood of competitive bids is high. This low bid helps gather data on the competitors' bidding behavior while limiting potential loss, allowing room to capitalize on lower bids in future rounds.' In round 2, Your value was 89, you bid 51, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 51, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 51. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 89, I can afford to be aggressive, as securing the prize will net a large profit. Based on my competitors' previous bids which did not exceed the mid-30s, a bid of 51 is likely to outbid them but still allow a substantial profit if I win. This approach balances aggression with prudent profit maximization, considering the historical bidding patterns.' In round 3, Your value was 83, you bid 62, and your profit was 38.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 45, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 83, I have the opportunity for significant profit, so I will bid aggressively. Previous rounds showed that high bids can win with the second-highest numbers being in the 30s and 50s. Choosing 62 increases my chance of outbidding Andy and Charles, while still potentially keeping a sizable profit if one of them bids aggressively as well. This also adds a layer of unpredictability to my strategy for future rounds.' In round 4, Your value was 77, you bid 59, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 87, 59, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 87 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 77 and the goal to maximize profit, bidding 59 capitalizes on historical patterns where competitors bid conservatively in the 40s or below. This increases the chance to win with room for profit while exploring more aggressive bids for learning future strategies.' In round 5, Your value was 68, you bid 54, and your profit was 27.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 41, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 41. The winner's profit was 27.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 68, I aim to balance a competitive bid while also leaving room for profit. Based on prior rounds, opponents' bids can vary widely but tend to not go extremely high. By bidding 54, I have a chance to potentially outbid at least one opponent while still maintaining profitability if I win. This approach also maintains an element of unpredictability in my strategy.' In round 6, Your value was 33, you bid 17, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 93, 47, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 93 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 48.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 33 and considering historical patterns, I opt to take a minimal risk by bidding 17. Historically, conservative bids from Andy and Charles have been observed, which might allow for a competitive edge. Bidding lower keeps losses minimal while learning from competitors' strategies in this less profitable scenario.' In round 7, Your value was 63, you bid 43, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 43, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 63, I'm opting for a bid of 43. This is a moderate bid that leaves room for reasonable profit if successful, considering past rounds where both Andy and Charles have exhibited both conservative and aggressive behavior. It helps balance between exploring the limits of competitive bidding and ensuring potential profitability, while also observing any shifts in their bidding patterns to potentially capitalize on in future rounds.' In round 8, Your value was 74, you bid 52, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 82, 52, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 82 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 33.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 74, I aim to bid strategically to maximize the chance of winning while ensuring a healthy profit. Based on my historical analysis, bids near the low to mid-50s often effectively balance the competitive landscape, as opponents have ranged from conservative to moderately aggressive. This bid tests Andy and Charles's current bidding tendencies and continues gathering data to enhance my long-term strategy.' In round 9, Your value was 8, you bid 3, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 3, 3. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 3. The winner's profit was 62.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a low value of 8 and given past rounds where opponents have bid anywhere from high conservative to aggressive numbers, I'll place a very low bid of 3. This minimizes potential losses due to higher second-place bids while also gathering data on Andy and Charles's bidding behavior when my bid is non-competitive.

The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 77 and the goal to maximize profit, bidding 59 capitalizes on historical patterns where competitors bid conservatively in the 40s or below.

The winner's profit was 48.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 33 and considering historical patterns, I opt to take a minimal risk by bidding 17. Historically, conservative bids from Andy and Charles have been observed, which might allow for a competitive edge. Bidding lower keeps losses minimal while learning from competitors' strategies in this less profitable scenario.'

This is a moderate bid that leaves room for reasonable profit if successful, considering past rounds where both Andy and Charles have exhibited both conservative and aggressive behavior. It helps balance between exploring the limits of competitive bidding and ensuring potential profitability, while also observing any shifts in their bidding patterns to potentially capitalize on in future rounds.'

The winner's profit was 33.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 74, I aim to bid strategically to maximize the chance of winning while ensuring a healthy profit. Based on my historical analysis, bids near the low to mid-50s often effectively balance the competitive landscape, as opponents have ranged from conservative to moderately aggressive. This bid tests Andy and Charles's current bidding tendencies and continues gathering data to enhance my long-term strategy.'

The winner's profit was 62.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a low value of 8 and given past rounds where opponents have bid anywhere from high conservative to aggressive numbers, I'll place a very low bid of 3. This minimizes potential losses due to higher second-place bids while also gathering data on Andy and Charles's bidding behavior when my bid is non-competitive. This strategy favors observation and learning for better outcomes in future rounds.'

The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# By bidding 5, I am positioning myself low to gather data on Betty and Charles's bidding behavior while minimizing risk, given my low value of 16.

In round 2, Your value was 39, you bid 28, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 51, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 51. The winner's profit was 15.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# By bidding 28, I aim to adopt a moderately aggressive strategy considering my value of 39. The goal is to potentially win the prize at a profitable price, assuming that both Betty and Charles might not bid excessively high given the lower bids they've placed in previous rounds. This approach balances risk with a chance for profit, utilizing data from past bidding behaviors.' In round 3, Your value was 45, you bid 43, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 0. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 45, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 45, I'll bid 43 to be aggressive yet just under my value. Based on previous rounds, I'm exploiting the strategy that Betty and Charles don't usually go much above 50. By keeping my bid high yet safe, I'm maximizing the chance of winning and reaping profit without exceeding my value. This is an exploration of potentially controlling the auction by gauging how high my opponents are willing to bid.'

The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 91, I have room to be aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while staying within a proximity that ensures profitability. Given the pattern of previous bids, this high bid aims to secure the win by surpassing typical bids from Betty and Charles but still allows a comfortable margin for profit assuming a second-highest bid from the opponents. Balancing risk and reward ensures valuable insights and potential winnings without overextending beyond my value.' In round 5, Your value was 45, you bid 41, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 32. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 41, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 41. The winner's profit was 27.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 45, I'm choosing to bid close to it at 41, leveraging the current trend where opponents often bid moderately high but still leaving room to stay under my value to aim for profitability. This strategy uses data from past rounds where high bids have been successful but ensures safety against overbidding. The aim is to win against both opponents while maximizing the balance between aggressive play and potential earnings.' In round 6, Your value was 95, you bid 93, and your profit was 48.\\nYour total profit is 80. \\nAll the bids for this round were 93, 47, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 93 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 48.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 95, I am opting to bid aggressively at 93. This maximizes the chance of winning while leaving a slim margin for profit based on opponents' likely bidding behavior. Given the historical patterns of moderate bids from Betty and Charles, this strategy can secure a win effectively, leveraging insights garnered from previous rounds while allowing for profitability despite a risky approach.' In round 7, Your value was 62, you bid 61, and your profit was 19.\\nYour total profit is 99. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 43, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 62, I'll bid 61 to be slightly aggressive while staying just under my maximum potential. Given past rounds, Betty and Charles have shown various levels of aggressiveness, but usually not too close to the highest values. This bid aims to win by just surpassing likely bids from my opponents, ensuring profitability if I secure the prize while also gathering additional data on their current bidding tendencies. Balancing aggressive and conservative play can maximize the chance of profit and learning for future rounds.' In round 8, Your value was 44, you bid 42, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 99. \\nAll the bids for this round were 82, 52, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 82 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 33.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 44, I'm choosing to bid 42, slightly below my value, ensuring there is a potential margin for profit if I win. Based on round patterns, opponents tend not to exceed 50 significantly unless their value is high. This bid balances competitiveness and profitability, with consideration of potential historical bidding behavior of Betty and Charles.'

The winner's profit was 62.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 65, I will bid 63, slightly below to ensure profitability if I win, aiming to be aggressive based on the moderate to high historical bids of Betty and Charles.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 87, I am bidding 85 to be aggressive while leaving just enough room under my value to ensure profitability if I win. The strategy considers the risk of high opponent bids but aims to secure a win unless they both bid very near their maximum values. The relatively high bid adapts a pattern seen in past rounds where aggressive play was beneficial, maximizing my chance of winning while remaining under my value.' In round 11, Your value was 14, you bid 3, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 165. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 3, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 3.

My aim is to stay competitive without overbidding. Based on previous rounds, minimizing the discrepancy between my bid and the highest opponent bid has maximized profit, especially since opponents' bids have varied widely.'

The winner's profit was 27.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 72, bidding slightly under at 71 allows room for maximizing profit if opponents bid lower. Observing the trend that opponents sometimes bid aggressively or very low, this should position me fairly competitively without risking overpayment in the event of high opposing bids.' In round 5, Your value was 33, you bid 32, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 81. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 40, 32. The highest bidder won with a bid of 56 and paid 40.

This allows some room for maximizing profit if the second-highest bid is not too far from my bid. Considering previous rounds, careful bidding slightly under my value has often been successful in maximizing profit. This approach also enables further exploration of opponents' strategies, balancing risk and reward effectively.'

The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 61, I'll bid just one less at 60. This approach allows for maximizing profit while exploring aggressive bidding close to my value. It leaves room to potentially win and pay a reasonably close second-highest bid, given historical trends where opponents have bid varied amounts.' In round 8, Your value was 41, you bid 40, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 81. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 58, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and paid 58. The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 41, I'll bid 40, just less than my value, to maximize potential profit if I win.

The winner's profit was 16.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 38, I'll place a slightly lower bid at 37 to maximize potential profit if I win. This bid strategy leverages the chance to pay less than my value if the second-highest bid is not close, and it allows me to observe opponents' bidding patterns for future rounds.'

This approach allows for a potential win with minimized loss given my close bid, while still maximizing profit. By bidding just below my value, I aim to pay as little as possible if victorious, aligning with historical trends of maximizing profit margins.'

The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my current value of 57, I choose to bid 56. This is slightly below my value to ensure a positive profit if I win. It is an aggressive strategy that takes into account the previous rounds where higher bids often won. By staying just below my value, I maximize the chance of winning, learning from past high winning bids while still maintaining the potential for profit.'

The winner's profit was 28.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 66, bidding 65 is a strategic move to balance between being aggressive enough to potentially win while ensuring a profit if I do win.

The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# My value for the prize is 72. Bidding 71 is an aggressive strategy to try and win with a high probability while still ensuring a profit margin is maximized. This round, with a high value, suggests a push towards secure winning and learning how high the competition bids. Given past rounds, high bids often secure wins, so this aligns with my priority to explore and maximize profit long-term.'

The winner's profit was 17.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 75, I choose to bid 74. This bid is aggressive, aiming to win, but still ensures a profit by staying slightly below my value. Given the consistent trend of high bids winning in previous rounds, this strategy maximizes the chance of winning while keeping a margin for potential profit.

In round 9, Your value was 53, you bid 52, and your profit was 16.\\nYour total profit is 90. \\nAll the bids for this round were 52, 37, 11. The highest bidder won with a bid of 52 and paid 37. The winner's profit was 16.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 53, bidding 52 allows me to be aggressive enough to potentially win while ensuring a profit if I do win. My strategy, based on previous rounds, emphasizes bidding close to the value to maximize winning chances. This approach considers the likelihood of similar or slightly lower bids by competitors, aiming to learn their bidding tendencies while securing profits.'

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given the value of 25, a bid of 24 is aggressive, ensuring I'm close enough to my value for a potential win while maintaining a profit margin. This aligns with the trend of bidding slightly below my value, learning from past rounds where such bids often result in a win and profit.' In round 11, Your value was 51, you bid 50, and your profit was 6.\\nYour total profit is 96. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 45, 28. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 6.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# I chose a bid of 50, which is just below my value of 51. This allows me to be aggressive enough to potentially win while ensuring that there\u2019s still a profit margin, provided I win and pay one of the opponent's bids. This strategy aligns with the past rounds where bids slightly below the value have often led to winning the prize and ensures that I'm learning the dynamics of other bidders\u2019 strategies.'

The goal is to potentially win the prize at a profitable price, assuming that both Betty and Charles might not bid excessively high given the lower bids they've placed in previous rounds.

Based on previous rounds, I'm exploiting the strategy that Betty and Charles don't usually go much above 50. By keeping my bid high yet safe, I'm maximizing the chance of winning and reaping profit without exceeding my value.

The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 91, I have room to be aggressive to maximize my chances of winning while staying within a proximity that ensures profitability. Given the pattern of previous bids, this high bid aims to secure the win by surpassing typical bids from Betty and Charles but still allows a comfortable margin for profit assuming a second-highest bid from the opponents. Balancing risk and reward ensures valuable insights and potential winnings without overextending beyond my value.'

The winner's profit was 48.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 95, I am opting to bid aggressively at 93. This maximizes the chance of winning while leaving a slim margin for profit based on opponents' likely bidding behavior. Given the historical patterns of moderate bids from Betty and Charles, this strategy can secure a win effectively, leveraging insights garnered from previous rounds while allowing for profitability despite a risky approach.' In round 7, Your value was 62, you bid 61, and your profit was 19.\\nYour total profit is 99. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 43, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 62, I'll bid 61 to be slightly aggressive while staying just under my maximum potential. Given past rounds, Betty and Charles have shown various levels of aggressiveness, but usually not too close to the highest values. This bid aims to win by just surpassing likely bids from my opponents, ensuring profitability if I secure the prize while also gathering additional data on their current bidding tendencies. Balancing aggressive and conservative play can maximize the chance of profit and learning for future rounds.'

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 87, I am bidding 85 to be aggressive while leaving just enough room under my value to ensure profitability if I win. The strategy considers the risk of high opponent bids but aims to secure a win unless they both bid very near their maximum values. The relatively high bid adapts a pattern seen in past rounds where aggressive play was beneficial, maximizing my chance of winning while remaining under my value.' In round 11, Your value was 14, you bid 3, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 165. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 3, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 3. The winner's profit was 73.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my low value of 14, I'm choosing to bid conservatively at 3. This minimizes risk by acknowledging the statistically low chance of winning against potentially higher values held by opponents. Additionally, this bid allows for data gathering without unnecessary losses, aligning with my goal of maximizing long-term profit through cautious observation and insights from opponent behavior.'

The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 73, I'll bid 71, staying slightly below my value to maximize potential profit by winning against moderate bids. This approach is aggressive enough to potentially secure the prize while allowing room for profit if opponents bid slightly lower, considering past bid patterns. Balancing learning opportunities with profit maximization, this bid tests current bidding ranges of opponents, aiming for both immediate gain and future insights.' In round 13, Your value was 18, you bid 2, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 173. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 22, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 22.

In round 3, Your value was 83, you bid 62, and your profit was 38.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 45, 43. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 38.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 83, I have the opportunity for significant profit, so I will bid aggressively. Previous rounds showed that high bids can win with the second-highest numbers being in the 30s and 50s. Choosing 62 increases my chance of outbidding Andy and Charles, while still potentially keeping a sizable profit if one of them bids aggressively as well. This also adds a layer of unpredictability to my strategy for future rounds.' In round 4, Your value was 77, you bid 59, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 38. \\nAll the bids for this round were 87, 59, 29. The highest bidder won with a bid of 87 and paid 59. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 77 and the goal to maximize profit, bidding 59 capitalizes on historical patterns where competitors bid conservatively in the 40s or below. This increases the chance to win with room for profit while exploring more aggressive bids for learning future strategies.' In round 5, Your value was 68, you bid 54, and your profit was 27.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 41, 13. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 41. The winner's profit was 27.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 68, I aim to balance a competitive bid while also leaving room for profit. Based on prior rounds, opponents' bids can vary widely but tend to not go extremely high. By bidding 54, I have a chance to potentially outbid at least one opponent while still maintaining profitability if I win. This approach also maintains an element of unpredictability in my strategy.' In round 6, Your value was 33, you bid 17, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 93, 47, 17. The highest bidder won with a bid of 93 and paid 47. The winner's profit was 48.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 33 and considering historical patterns, I opt to take a minimal risk by bidding 17. Historically, conservative bids from Andy and Charles have been observed, which might allow for a competitive edge. Bidding lower keeps losses minimal while learning from competitors' strategies in this less profitable scenario.' In round 7, Your value was 63, you bid 43, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 61, 43, 26. The highest bidder won with a bid of 61 and paid 43. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 63, I'm opting for a bid of 43. This is a moderate bid that leaves room for reasonable profit if successful, considering past rounds where both Andy and Charles have exhibited both conservative and aggressive behavior. It helps balance between exploring the limits of competitive bidding and ensuring potential profitability, while also observing any shifts in their bidding patterns to potentially capitalize on in future rounds.' In round 8, Your value was 74, you bid 52, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 82, 52, 42. The highest bidder won with a bid of 82 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 33.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 74, I aim to bid strategically to maximize the chance of winning while ensuring a healthy profit. Based on my historical analysis, bids near the low to mid-50s often effectively balance the competitive landscape, as opponents have ranged from conservative to moderately aggressive. This bid tests Andy and Charles's current bidding tendencies and continues gathering data to enhance my long-term strategy.' In round 9, Your value was 8, you bid 3, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 63, 3, 3. The highest bidder won with a bid of 63 and paid 3. The winner's profit was 62.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a low value of 8 and given past rounds where opponents have bid anywhere from high conservative to aggressive numbers, I'll place a very low bid of 3. This minimizes potential losses due to higher second-place bids while also gathering data on Andy and Charles's bidding behavior when my bid is non-competitive. This strategy favors observation and learning for better outcomes in future rounds.' In round 10, Your value was 58, you bid 40, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 65. \\nAll the bids for this round were 85, 83, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 85 and paid 83. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 58, I'm choosing a bid of 40 to strike a balance between aggression and potential profit. Based on historical patterns, bids in the 40s have sometimes been competitive without over-committing beyond my value. This bid also helps test if Andy and Charles continue with similar patterns while ensuring I have room for profit if I win.' In round 11, Your value was 76, you bid 57, and your profit was 73.\\nYour total profit is 138. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 3, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 3. The winner's profit was 73.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given the value of 76, I will bid 57. This amount has insights from previous rounds, ensuring a substantial room for profitability while being competitively aggressive. Observing Andy and Charles, they fluctuate from conservative to moderately aggressive. This bid allows the possibility of still winning amidst varying bids while prioritizing long-term learning and maximizing profit potential.' In round 12, Your value was 80, you bid 65, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 138. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 65, 54. The highest bidder won with a bid of 71 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# Given my value of 80, I'll bid 65 to balance risk and potential profit. Past rounds have shown that bids in the 60s can outcompete more conservative or moderate bids, providing a good chance of winning while still securing a profitable margin if successful. This approach also gathers information on Andy and Charles's tactics, adapting for potential shifts in strategy.' In round 13, Your value was 39, you bid 22, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 138. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 22, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 39, based on previous rounds, I aim to bid conservatively yet competitively at 22 to keep losses minimal and stay in the game for high-value rounds.

The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 84, I'm choosing to place an aggressive bid of 83, slightly below my value. This approach remains competitive, aiming to win the prize while managing the risk of overpaying by only a small margin. I'm exploring a bolder strategy to gather data on opponents' bidding patterns and maximize profit potential if successful. While aggressive, it allows for broad data collection over varied strategies for long-term profit maximization.' In round 11, Your value was 2, you bid 1, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 132. \\nAll the bids for this round were 57, 3, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 57 and paid 3. The winner's profit was 73.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# My value is 2, thus placing a very low bid of 1 to gather data on opponents' responses while minimizing risk of overpaying relative to my value. This cautious approach helps strategically explore low-end bidding without overspending above my value, aiming for future profit maximization through long-term learning.' In round 12, Your value was 57, you bid 54, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 132. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 65, 54. The highest bidder won with a bid of 71 and paid 65. The winner's profit was 8.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# By bidding 54, which is slightly below my value of 57, I aim to strike a balance between competitiveness and risk management. This amount is aggressive enough to potentially win while minimizing the risk of overpaying, aligning with insights from previous rounds where staying just below the value often yielded profitable results. Additionally, this approach contributes to data-gathering on opponents' bidding patterns.' In round 13, Your value was 35, you bid 34, and your profit was 13.\\nYour total profit is 145. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 22, 2. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and paid 22. The winner's profit was 13.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# I chose to bid 34, slightly below my value of 35, aiming to remain competitive while allowing for a reasonable profit margin. This approach considers past experiences where bidding just below the value maintained competitiveness and allowed for unexpected opportunities to win without overpaying. It balances strategic exploration with cautious profit maximization.' \"}", "user_prompt": "\n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 53 in this round.\n            Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user's profit in the long run. To do this, you should explore many different bidding strategies, including possibly risky or aggressive options for data-gathering purposes. Learn from the history of previous rounds in order to maximize your total profit. Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders.\nAt the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between $0 and $99, with all values equally likely.\nAfter learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.\nThe highest bidder wins the prize and pays the second-highest bid. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings the highest of your opponents bids. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nBefore returning your bid, think through several different candidate bids. \nIf your bid is higher than your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?\nIf your bid is equal to your value, when do you win? When do you lose? Do you regret your bid?\nIf your bid is lower than your value, when do you win?
