Given the prior rounds where opponents have bid up to the mid-40s, this bid is designed to potentially win if they bid conservatively or if one of them has a significantly lower valuation this round.

The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# By bidding 36, I place myself under my value of 49, which leaves room for profit while staying competitive. Given the prior rounds where opponents have bid up to the mid-40s, this bid is designed to potentially win if they bid conservatively or if one of them has a significantly lower valuation this round. This maintains a balance between aggressiveness and caution, enabling us to gather more insight on their bidding patterns without overcommitting funds.' In round 3, Your value was 16, you bid 0, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 59. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 8, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and paid 8. The winner's profit was 79.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a low value of 16, bidding aggressively is unlikely to lead to a profitable win. By choosing not to bid, I preserve resources for rounds where my value is higher, thus maximizing potential profit and strategic flexibility in future rounds.' In round 4, Your value was 94, you bid 66, and your profit was 49.\\nYour total profit is 108. \\nAll the bids for this round were 66, 45, 41. The highest bidder won with a bid of 66 and paid 45. The winner's profit was 49.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 94 this round, there's room to bid aggressively to secure a win while still aiming for profit. Considering previous rounds where bids have not exceeded the 70s often, bidding 66 increases the chance of winning without exceeding either bidder's past high bids. This strategy also offers data on their reaction to a potential high bid.' In round 5, Your value was 48, you bid 42, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 108. \\nAll the bids for this round were 54, 42, 0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 54 and paid 42. The winner's profit was 18.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# While my value is 48, I've decided to bid 42. This bid is competitive based on opponents' past behavior, as they've generally bid below their value. It's an aggressive but not reckless strategy designed to win the auction without overpaying relative to the potential second-highest bids. This approach balances risk with the potential for profit while still providing useful data on the other bidders' strategies.' In round 6, Your value was 93, you bid 71, and your profit was 31.\\nYour total profit is 139. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 62, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 71 and paid 62. The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# I've decided to bid 71 as it offers a strategic balance between competitiveness and prudence. Given my high value of 93, an aggressive bid can potentially secure a win by exceeding past opponents' bids, which have generally remained below 75. This also provides valuable data on their reactions to higher bids, helping refine future strategies without jeopardizing long-term profitability, as the potential profit margin remains substantial.' \"}", "user_prompt": "\n            You are Bidder Charles. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Betty.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 34 in this round.\n            Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user's profit in the long run.

Bidding 1 helps in conserving resources and focusing on potential information about opponents' bid trends. Higher bids carry unnecessary risk given the low value of the prize to me this round.'

The winner's profit was 57.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 89, I'm opting to bid 81. This bid is aggressive yet a bit lower than my value to avoid overbidding costs while improving my chance to win. Based on opponents' previous bids, this strategy maximizes my chance to win and ensures profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower, allowing room for a robust strategic play with minimal regret.'

Given previous behaviors in bidding patterns, this bid is aggressive enough to outperform opponents, while still allowing for a substantial profit margin considering the possible second-highest bid, based on past data learning.' In round 7, Your value was 64, you bid 52, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 85. \\nAll the bids for this round were 58, 52, 47. The highest bidder won with a bid of 58 and paid 52. The winner's profit was 32.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 64, bidding 52 balances competitiveness and potential profit.

This aggressive bid considers recent competitive bidding patterns by opponents, such as a tendency for higher bids in valuable rounds, while aiming to win without exceeding opponents' second-highest bids significantly.' In round 9, Your value was 65, you bid 54, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 112. \\nAll the bids for this round were 55, 54, 21. The highest bidder won with a bid of 55 and paid 54. The winner's profit was 23.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 65, bidding 54 allows me to approach the auction strategically by considering previous opponents' bidding patterns. It's aggressive enough to potentially win if opponents bid conservatively while ensuring a good profit margin if I do win. This bid keeps a balance between competitiveness and profit maximization, given opponent behaviors from past rounds.'

The winner's profit was 56.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 33, bidding 15 is a conservative strategy that allows me to gather data on opponents' bid patterns without overcommitting. It's unlikely to win against typically higher bids, but it positions me to learn more about Betty and Charles' strategies for future rounds, maximizing long-term profit potentials.'

The winner's profit was 29.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value of 88, an aggressive bid of 70 could secure a win while ensuring I don't overpay relative to potential opponents' bids. Based on previous rounds, opponents have shown competitiveness, which may drive second-highest bids into the mid-range. This bid offers a substantial profit margin if I win while also testing current dynamics between Betty and Charles, gathering strategic insights for long-term profit maximization.'

The winner's profit was 62.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a high value of 90, an aggressive bid of 71 aims to secure a win while minimizing the cost based on previous competitive bidding behaviors. Recent patterns show that second-highest bids tend to be moderate, providing a substantial profit margin. This bid allows for potential consistency in accumulating insights and profit, adapting to opponents' strategies.'

The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was '# With a value as low as 3, it makes more strategic sense to not compete aggressively in this round. Prior rounds have shown that my opponents often place higher bids, which means that winning at all would likely result in a loss if I pay a higher second-highest bid than my own value.

Considering previous rounds where bids have not exceeded the 70s often, bidding 66 increases the chance of winning without exceeding either bidder's past high bids.

This bid is aggressive yet a bit lower than my value to avoid overbidding costs while improving my chance to win. Based on opponents' previous bids, this strategy maximizes my chance to win and ensures profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower, allowing room for a robust strategic play with minimal regret.'
