If others bid way higher, I don't regret my low bid as it was a low-risk exploration. It shows I may need to increase future bids. I should continuously adapt my strategy considering the trends of the other bidders\u2019 actions. I'll start testing with moderately high bids then, depending upon outcomes, experiment with lower or higher bids to increase long-term profits. Through these methods, I maximize profit, embracing both success and failures as learning opportunities.",

If others bid high, I'd learn from it but wouldn't regret bidding lower. It informs future strategy whether I'm dealing with aggressive or conservative bidders. My next strategy is to test moderated bidding - mid-high range if my drawn value is high, to allow room for profit while avoiding overbidding. It's essential to keep adapting and taking calculated risks to gain a variety of data for future trends analysis and profit maximization.",

For my next bidding strategies, I plan to test progressive bidding, starting low and gradually increasing depending on other bidders' behaviours. Also, I'd test a higher intro bid, to gauge actions of other bidders. Both strategies involve calculated risks, designed for long term profits."
