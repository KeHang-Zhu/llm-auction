If the other bidders bid higher than mine, while I may miss out on potential profit, I would note that I need to foresee such aggressive strategies and possibly adopt them in the future. For my next strategies, I plan to experiment with a fluctuating bid system. Initially, I'll bid aggressively within the higher range (60-99) for 20% of the total auctions to gauge other bidder tendencies. After this exploratory phase, based on trends observed in the other bidders' bidding patterns, I'll either continue aggressive bidding or switch to mid-range (30-59) or low-end (0-29) bidding. This approach will maximize information gathering while balancing profit opportunities.",

My next strategy would be to analyze patterns of my competitors, have some rounds with lower bids to gather data, then gradually increase bids based on observed patterns. This exploration-exploitation method should help maximize long-term profit."
