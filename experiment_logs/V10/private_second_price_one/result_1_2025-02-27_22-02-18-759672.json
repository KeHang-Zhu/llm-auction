This introduces unpredictability.\n\n4. Average Strategy: Calculate the average of my value and the previous highest winning bid, and bid this.\n\n5. Mirror Strategy: Bid the same as the last highest bid, hoping to win through tie-breaker.",

This maximizes potential profit but risks overpaying.\n\n3. Random Strategy: Bid a random value between $0 and my value. This introduces unpredictability.\n\n4. Adaptive Strategy: Start with a conservative approach. If I lose, increase my next bid by 10%. If I win, decrease the next bid by 10%.",

This maximizes my chances of winning, but risks high losses.\n\n3. Average Strategy: Bid the average of the possible values ($50). This balances risk and potential reward.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random value between $0 and $99. This introduces unpredictability into my bidding.\n\n5. Incremental Strategy: If my value is above $50, bid incrementally higher each time. This strategy attempts to outbid others without overpaying."
