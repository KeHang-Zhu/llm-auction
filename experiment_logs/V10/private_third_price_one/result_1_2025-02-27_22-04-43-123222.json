This increases my chances of winning but risks a higher potential loss.\n\n3. Calculated Risk Strategy: Bid slightly more than half my value, say 60%. This balances the risk and reward.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random value between half and full value. This introduces unpredictability.\n\n5. Counter Strategy: If I notice a pattern in other bidders' strategies, adjust my bid accordingly to exploit their weaknesses.",
            "Plan:\n\n1. Test conservative strategy: Bid low, around 25% of my value, to minimize potential losses, while occasionally winning when others bid extremely low.\n\n2. Test aggressive strategy: Bid close to my value, around 75-90%, to increase chances of winning. This risks high payment but could yield high profit.\n\n3. Test random strategy: Bid a random amount each time, to make my bidding unpredictable.\n\n4. Test adaptive strategy: Initially bid low, then gradually increase based on others' bidding behavior. If they tend to bid high, start bidding high. If they bid low, keep bidding low."
