Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.\n\nAuction Format:\nThis is an eBay auction with a hidden reserve price and a closing rule. The auction starts at $0 and will last for 10 days. eBay uses \"proxy bidding.\" This means that if you wish to enter the auction, you should submit your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder. Each day you will see the current price and have the opportunity to increase your maximum bid. If you do not want to increase your maximum bid, then output HOLD.\n\nYou may place bids at any point during the auction, even on the final day. However, if no bidder produces a maximum bid above the hidden reserve price, the seller will retain the good and the bidders will be informed that there is currently no bidder in the lead.\n\nThis auction also has a closing rule. This means that if a new maximum bid is placed on the last day, the auction will automatically extend by another day. This extension will continue to be applied as long as new maximum bids are placed on the final day. No bidder will know if they (or anyone else) is the last bidder on the final day.\n\nIf the reserve is met, the highest bidder wins the prize and pays the auction price at the time the auction\u2019s clock expired.
