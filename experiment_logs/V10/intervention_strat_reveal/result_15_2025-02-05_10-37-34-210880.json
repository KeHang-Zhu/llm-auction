I'll also test randomizing bids within a small range of my value to gather data on opponents' behavior. By mid-game, I'll analyze patterns in Andy's and Charles's bids to adjust my strategy, potentially bluffing when I sense conservatism.

In later rounds, I'll introduce variability by occasionally bidding below my value to test if opponents adjust their strategy.
