In the final round, I'll implement a balanced strategy, adjusting my bids based on insights from previous rounds.

In the final round, I'll adapt based on previous rounds: if competitors bid high, I'll be more aggressive; if they bid low, I'll be conservative. Throughout, I'll monitor when others exit to fine-tune my approach. This adaptive strategy aims to maximize profit by leveraging insights from competitor behavior and value distribution.",

In Round 3, I'll adapt based on previous rounds: if others bid high, I'll push near my value; if they bid low, I'll stop slightly above the average winning bid from earlier rounds.
