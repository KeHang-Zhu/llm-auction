If opponents bid conservatively, I'll exploit this by increasing my bids slightly above their previous limits. If they bid aggressively, I'll adopt a more cautious approach, withdrawing earlier to minimize potential losses. This will help balance risk and maximize long-term profit.",

In Round 2, I'll shift to an aggressive strategy, staying until 90% of my value to test opponents' reactions and explore potential for higher profit. I'll monitor when opponents drop out to estimate their values and adjust my strategy accordingly. This approach balances risk and reward, leveraging insights from Round 1 to maximize profit in Round 2.",

This will help assess their risk tolerance and value estimation. In the second round, I'll adjust my strategy based on the first round's observations. If they bid conservatively, I'll bid slightly above their previous exit prices. If they bid aggressively, I'll aim for a mid-range bid to maximize profit while minimizing risk. This approach balances exploration and exploitation to optimize long-term profit."
