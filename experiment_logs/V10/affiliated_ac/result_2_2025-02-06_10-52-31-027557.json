This helps gauge the aggressiveness of Betty and Charles. In the second round, I'll pivot to a more aggressive strategy, staying longer to test higher bids, especially if the first round's values were high. This approach balances risk and learning, maximizing potential profit by adapting to opponents' behaviors and value distributions. I'll use insights from round one to refine my second-round strategy for optimal bidding.",

In Round 2, I'll adjust based on Round 1 insights. If opponents bid aggressively, I'll exit earlier, around 60% of my value, to avoid overpaying. If they bid conservatively, I'll push closer to my full value. This adaptive approach maximizes profit by balancing risk and reward, leveraging insights from previous rounds to refine my strategy.",

I'll note when Andy and Betty drop out to estimate their value range. In the second round, I'll adopt a more conservative strategy, exiting earlier to maximize profit if my value is lower, using insights from the first round to predict their bidding patterns. This approach balances risk and data collection, optimizing long-term profit by adapting to observed strategies."
