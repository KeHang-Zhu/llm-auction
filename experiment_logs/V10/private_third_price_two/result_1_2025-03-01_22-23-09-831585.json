Aggressive Strategy: Bid my exact value. This maximizes my chances of winning, but risks a loss if the third-highest bid is high.\n\n3. Calculated Risk Strategy: Bid slightly less than my value (e.g., 90% of it). This balances between winning chances and profit margin.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount between $0 and my value. This introduces unpredictability to my bidding behavior.",
            "1. Conservative Strategy: Bid low, around 20-30% of my prize value. This minimizes loss if I don't win, but still gives a chance to win if others bid lower.\n2. Moderate Strategy: Bid half of my prize value. This balances between risk and reward.\n3. Aggressive Strategy: Bid close to my prize value (80-90%). This maximizes potential profit but also risk.\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount within my prize value to introduce unpredictability."
