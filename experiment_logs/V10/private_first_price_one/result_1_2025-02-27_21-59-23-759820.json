Mid Value Strategy: If my value is between $34-$66, I will bid half of my value. This balances risk and potential profit.\n\n3. High Value Strategy: If my value is between $67-$99, I will bid $66. This maximizes potential profit while minimizing the chance of overbidding.",

Calculated Strategy: Bid slightly more than half my value, based on competitors' previous bids.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount within my value.\n\n5. Incremental Strategy: Start with a low bid and increase incrementally in subsequent rounds, depending on my value.\n\n6. Decremental Strategy: Start with a high bid and decrease incrementally in subsequent rounds, depending on my value.",
            "1. Conservative Strategy: Bid low, around 30% of the value. This ensures minimal loss if I don't win, and maximizes profit if I do.\n\n2. Aggressive Strategy: Bid high, around 70% of the value. This increases chances of winning, but reduces potential profit.\n\n3. Average Strategy: Bid at 50% of the value. This balances risk and reward.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount each time. This introduces unpredictability, which may confuse other bidders.\n\n5. Value Strategy: Bid exactly the value. This ensures no loss nor gain."
