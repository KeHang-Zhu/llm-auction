Experiment with aggressive bids over $80 regardless of competitor behavior, but cautiously observe patterns for adjustment. Gauge opponent tendencies: if recurring high bids exist, consider underbidding or matching their patterns for information.

Adjust strategy dynamically, reinforcing successful patterns and modifying based on profit analysis and opponent behavior. Aim to optimize by exploiting rivals' tendencies.",

I'll also gather data by adjusting my bid slightly based on past trends of winning and losing bid values. By doing this, I can explore how current bidding behavior of Andy and Charles varies and identify if they underbid or match values closely. This strategy maximizes the chances of winning while minimizing costs for higher profit potential.",

For low values (<40), adopt a conservative approach, bidding minimally or not at all to conserve resources and observe other bidders' behaviors. Occasionally, introduce random high bids with low values to gauge their reactions and collect data.
