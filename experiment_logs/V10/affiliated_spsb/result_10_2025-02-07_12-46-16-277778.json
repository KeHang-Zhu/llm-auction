Prioritize maximizing profit while minimizing overbidding, refining strategy through dynamic observation and adaptive bidding.",
            "In the next round, I'll bid slightly below my value for high values to increase profit margins. For low values, bid minimally. Adjust based on competitors' bids, shadow bidding just below the second-highest bid if necessary. This strategy aims to optimize profit while adapting to competitors' patterns.",
            "In the final round, I'll bid close to my value, slightly above the second-highest expected bid, to maximize profit. I'll analyze previous bids to predict competitors' behavior, ensuring a strategic balance between winning and cost efficiency for optimal long-term gains."
