Track patterns in Betty's and Charles's bids to adjust your strategy dynamically. If a consistent pattern emerges, exploit it by slightly undercutting their maximum bids. Prioritize learning their risk levels and adjust aggressiveness accordingly. Use this information to optimize bids, aiming for high-value wins at minimal costs over the 10 rounds.",

Mid-game, I'll adjust strategies based on patterns, potentially using bluffing tactics when values are moderate. In later rounds, I'll refine my approach to maximize profit by leveraging insights gained, balancing aggression with caution based on observed bidding trends and competitors' risk tolerance.",

I'll also experiment with bluffing by occasionally bidding slightly above my value when it's low to test their response.

Focus on maximizing profit by balancing aggression and caution, refining tactics based on observed patterns and competitors' risk tolerance, aiming to optimize bids for potential wins and profit.",
