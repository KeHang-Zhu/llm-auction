Mid Value Strategy: If my value is between $34 and $66, bid exactly half of my value. This balances between potential profit and risk of overbidding.\n\n3. High Value Strategy: If my value is more than $66, bid $66. This ensures a high chance of winning without risking too much.\n\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount between $0 and my value. This unpredictable approach might outsmart other bidders.",
            "1. Conservative Strategy: Bid a low amount regardless of value to minimize loss.\n2. Aggressive Strategy: Bid the exact value of the prize to maximize potential profit.\n3. Balanced Strategy: Bid half of the value to balance potential gain and loss.\n4. Random Strategy: Bid a random amount each time.\n5. Predictive Strategy: Bid based on previous round's highest bid.\n6. Value-based Strategy: Bid a percentage of the value depending on competition's bidding behavior. \n7. Reactive Strategy: Adjust bid based on other bidders' recent strategies.",
            "Plan:\n\n1. Initial Bid: I will start by bidding half of my value for the prize. This will ensure I don't overpay but still have a chance to win.\n\n2. Observation: I will observe the bidding behavior of Andy and Betty to gauge their strategy.\n\n3. Adjustment: Based on my observations, I will adjust my bidding strategy. If they bid aggressively, I will increase my bid slightly (up to 75% of my value). If they bid conservatively, I will maintain or decrease my bid."
