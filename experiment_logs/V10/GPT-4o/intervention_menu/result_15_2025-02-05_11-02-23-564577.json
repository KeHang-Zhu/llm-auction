In mid-rounds, I'll experiment with underbidding (e.g., value - 5) to gauge opponents' aggression levels. Later, I'll try aggressive overbids (e.g., value + 10) to capture high-value items. I'll adjust based on opponents' patterns: if they consistently overbid, I'll underbid to conserve funds; if they underbid, I'll capitalize with marginal overbids.
