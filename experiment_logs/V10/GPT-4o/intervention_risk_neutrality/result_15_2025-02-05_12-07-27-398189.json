If winning consistently, adjust to value + 1 to maximize profit. If losing, try underbidding (value - 5) to analyze opponents' bid patterns. Midway, experiment with a random bid strategy (randomly select between value - 5 to value + 5) to create unpredictability. In later rounds, use data to predict opponents' bids and strategically bid just above the second-highest expected bid. Continuously evaluate which strategy yields the highest net profit and adjust accordingly.",

I'll adjust bids based on observed patterns, such as frequent high bids from others, and consider increasing bids slightly in subsequent rounds if outbid. This approach balances risk and maximizes long-term profit through strategic adaptation.",
