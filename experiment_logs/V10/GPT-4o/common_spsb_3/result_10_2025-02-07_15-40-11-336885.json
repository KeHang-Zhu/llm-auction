Adapt based on competitors' patterns, focusing on balancing strategic aggression and underbidding to refine strategy and optimize long-term profit.",

If opponents bid high, consider slightly higher bids; if low, stay conservative. Focus on maximizing profit by balancing risk and leveraging insights from previous rounds."
