Balance risk and reward, aiming to match or exceed competitors' bids strategically while maximizing profit potential. Prioritize data gathering for long-term optimization.",
            "In the final round, bid slightly above perceived value, factoring in competitors' past second-highest bids. Prioritize securing a win while minimizing overbidding risk. Adjust based on observed patterns to optimize profit, balancing strategic aggression with caution. Continuously adapt to maintain competitiveness and maximize long-term profit.",
            "**Round 9 Plan:** Bid strategically close to perceived value, adjusting based on observed opponent patterns. If opponents bid aggressively, increase bid slightly above perceived value (+5-7) to enhance winning chances. Prioritize maximizing potential profit while minimizing overbidding risks, leveraging insights from previous rounds."
