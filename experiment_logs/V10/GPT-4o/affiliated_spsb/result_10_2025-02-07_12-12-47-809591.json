Track patterns in Betty's and Charles's bids to adjust your strategy dynamically. If a consistent pattern emerges, exploit it by slightly undercutting their maximum bids. Prioritize learning their risk levels and adjust aggressiveness accordingly. Use this information to optimize bids, aiming for high-value wins at minimal costs over the 10 rounds.",

Mid-game, I'll adjust strategies based on patterns, potentially using bluffing tactics when values are moderate. In later rounds, I'll refine my approach to maximize profit by leveraging insights gained, balancing aggression with caution based on observed bidding trends and competitors' risk tolerance.",

If my value exceeds 30, I'll test aggressive bids at 80-90% to assess their risk tolerance. I'll also experiment with bluffing by occasionally bidding slightly above my value when it's low to test their response.

Adjust bids based on Betty's and Charles's patterns, undercutting their max bids when possible. Prioritize profit by balancing aggressive and conservative bids strategically.",
            "In round 9, bid 75% of high values, aiming slightly above expected second-highest bids. For low values, bid minimally. Test aggressive bluffs with moderate values. Refine strategy by leveraging insights on competitors' behaviors, balancing aggression and caution to optimize profit while exploiting observed risk tolerance.",
            "In the final round, I'll bid 90% of my value if it's over 25, otherwise 85%. I'll focus on slightly undercutting Andy's and Betty's typical bids, aiming for a win with minimal excess. This balances competitiveness with profit, learning from past patterns."
