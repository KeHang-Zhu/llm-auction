Adjust dynamically based on observed patterns, aiming to optimize profit through strategic bidding and better understanding of opponents' tendencies.",
            "For the final round, bid slightly above the expected second-highest bid based on observed patterns. Adjust for competitors' tendencies, ensuring a positive margin. Occasionally test minimal bids for data. Prioritize adaptive, informed bidding to maximize profit without overpaying.",
            "In the final round, I'll bid slightly above my value to test competitors' limits, aiming to win by just outbidding the second-highest bid. This approach balances securing a win with minimizing costs, leveraging insights from previous rounds to maximize profit potential."
