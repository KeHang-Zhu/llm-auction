Track patterns in Betty's and Charles's bids to adjust your strategy dynamically. If a consistent pattern emerges, exploit it by slightly undercutting their maximum bids. Prioritize learning their risk levels and adjust aggressiveness accordingly. Use this information to optimize bids, aiming for high-value wins at minimal costs over the 10 rounds.",

Mid-game, I'll adjust strategies based on patterns, potentially using bluffing tactics when values are moderate. In later rounds, I'll refine my approach to maximize profit by leveraging insights gained, balancing aggression with caution based on observed bidding trends and competitors' risk tolerance.",

If my value exceeds 30, I'll test aggressive bids at 80-90% to assess their risk tolerance. I'll also experiment with bluffing by occasionally bidding slightly above my value when it's low to test their response. Throughout, I'll adjust based on observed patterns, identifying if they consistently bid high or low, and adapt by undercutting or outbidding them strategically.

Prioritize high-value wins at minimal costs, balancing risk and reward dynamically based on observed behaviors to optimize profit.",

Bid minimally for low values. Focus on optimizing profit by leveraging insights on competitors\u2019 risk tolerance and bidding patterns.",

Prioritize profit maximization by adapting dynamically to observed bidding patterns and adjusting aggression based on value insights."
