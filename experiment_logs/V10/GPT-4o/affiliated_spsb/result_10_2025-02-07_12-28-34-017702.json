            "Bid slightly below value if high, minimally if low. Occasionally bid 1-3 above value to test risk tolerance. Focus on matching or slightly exceeding second-highest past bids. Adapt based on competitors' patterns to optimize profit and secure wins efficiently. Prioritize aggressive bids in high-value situations.",
            "In the final round, I'll bid slightly above my value to ensure a competitive edge, while monitoring for high bids. I'll aim to stay just above the second-highest bid to maximize profit, using observed patterns to adjust. Random bids will be minimal to focus on strategic wins."
