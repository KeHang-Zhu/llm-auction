Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 20 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 1. The price for next clock cycle is 2.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.

Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 2, the price was 1, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 3, the price was 2, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 4, the price was 3, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 26 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 4. The price for next clock cycle is 5.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.

Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 2, the price was 1, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 3, the price was 2, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 4, the price was 3, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 5, the price was 4, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 6, the price was 5, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 7, the price was 6, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 8, the price was 7, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 9, the price was 8, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 10, the price was 9, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 11, the price was 10, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 31 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 11. The price for next clock cycle is 12.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.

Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 2, the price was 1, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 3, the price was 2, 1 players dropped out', 'In clock round 4, the price was 3, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 5, the price was 4, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 6, the price was 5, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 7, the price was 6, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 8, the price was 7, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 25 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 8. The price for next clock cycle is 9.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.

Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 26 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 1. The price for next clock cycle is 2.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.

Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.\nYour value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. \nWhen there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nThe previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 2, the price was 1, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 3, the price was 2, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 4, the price was 3, no players dropped out', 'In clock round 5, the price was 4, no players dropped out'].\nYour value towards to the prize is 27 in this round.\nThe current price in this clock cycle is 5. The price for next clock cycle is 6.\nDo you want to stay in the bidding? \nIf you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. \nIf you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.\nYour response must use these EXACT tags below.
