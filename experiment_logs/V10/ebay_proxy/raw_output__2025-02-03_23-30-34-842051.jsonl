The auction starts at $0 and will last for 10 days. eBay uses \"proxy bidding.\" This means that if you wish to enter the auction, you should submit your maximum bid, and eBay will automatically bid on your behalf, up to your maximum, only as much as necessary to maintain your position as the highest bidder. Each day you will see the current price and have the opportunity to increase your maximum bid. If you do not want to increase your maximum bid, then output HOLD.\n\nYou may place bids at any point during the auction, even on the final day. No bidder will know if they (or anyone else) is the last bidder on the final day.\n\nThe highest bidder wins the prize and pays the auction price at the time the auction\u2019s clock expired. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the final auction price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.\nYou are Bidder Betty. Your private value for this item is $86. This is the maximum amount you are willing to pay.
