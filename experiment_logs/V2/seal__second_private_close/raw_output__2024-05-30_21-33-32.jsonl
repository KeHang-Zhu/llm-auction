The prize may have a different dollar value for each person in your group. You will play this game for  rounds. All dollar amounts in this game are in 1 increments.\nAt the start of each round, we display your value for this round\u2019s prize. If you win the prize, you will earn the value of the prize, minus any payments from the auction. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows: \n1. For each group we will draw a common value, which will be between 10 and 100. Every number between 10 and 100 is equally likely to be drawn. \n2. For each person, we will also draw a private adjustment, which will be between 0 and . Every number between 0 and  is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 10 and 120, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid.
