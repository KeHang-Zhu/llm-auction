In round 3, all the submitted bids were 70,70,59. Your value was 69. And you bid 59.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 13. Your total profit is 17 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 69, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning, but not so high that I risk overpaying relative to the second-highest bid. Bidding 59 strikes a balance, as it is close enough to my value to be competitive while leaving a reasonable buffer to ensure a profit if I win.' In round 4, all the submitted bids were 65,70,55. Your value was 62. And you bid 55.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 17. Your total profit is 17 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for the prize, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but leave enough margin to ensure a profit. Bidding 55 allows for a significant buffer below my value, maximizing the likelihood of winning while ensuring a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 5, all the submitted bids were 62,65,65. Your value was 76. And you bid 65.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 7. Your total profit is 17 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 76 for the prize, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning while leaving enough margin to ensure a profit. Bidding 65 allows for a significant buffer below my value, maximizing the likelihood of winning while ensuring a profit margin if the second-highest bid is lower.' In round 6, all the submitted bids were 10,19,20. Your value was 31. And you bid 20.  Your profit was 12 and winner's profit was 12. Your total profit is 29 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 31, I want to bid low enough to ensure a good profit margin if I win, but still high enough to be competitive. Based on previous rounds, bids tend to be higher, so bidding 20 gives me a chance to win if others bid conservatively, while minimizing my risk of overpaying.' In round 7, all the submitted bids were 45,55,45. Your value was 53. And you bid 45.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 17. Your total profit is 29 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 53, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but leave a margin to ensure a profit if I win. Based on previous rounds, bidding around 45 seems to be a competitive bid while providing a buffer below my value to maximize profit.' In round 8, all the submitted bids were 35,55,45. Your value was 52. And you bid 45.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 16. Your total profit is 29 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 52, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but leave enough margin to ensure a profit.

By bidding 28, I balance the risk of overbidding while still having a good chance to win if the other bidders' values are lower. This strategy aims to maximize my total profit over the rounds.' In round 6, all the submitted bids were 26,35,20. Your value was 23. And you bid 20.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 14.

Bidding 59 allows me to potentially outbid the others, assuming their bids are lower, and still provides a margin for profit if the second-highest bid is significantly lower than my value.'

Bidding 49 provides a balance between offering a competitive bid and leaving room for profit, as it is below my value but high enough to potentially outbid the others.

In round 5, all the submitted bids were 55,60,52. Your value was 62. And you bid 52.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 19. Your total profit is 24 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 62, I want to ensure I make a profit if I win. Bidding 52 allows me to potentially outbid the other bidders while leaving a margin for profit.

In round 6, all the submitted bids were 20,10,10. Your value was 19. And you bid 10.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 10. Your total profit is 24 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value for the prize is 19, I should bid below my value to ensure I make a profit if I win. Bidding 10 allows me to potentially win the prize at a lower cost while still providing a reasonable chance of winning against the other bidders.
