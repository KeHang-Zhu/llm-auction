At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize.

At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 10 and 40, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to the second-highest bid. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings the second-highest bid.

By bidding 18, I aim to win the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, considering the second-highest bid will determine my payment.' In round 3, all the submitted bids were 22,24,32. Your value was 33. And you bid 32.  Your profit was 9 and winner's profit was 9. Your total profit is 9 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 33, so I will bid 32 to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I make a profit. Given the previous bids have been lower than my value, bidding just below my value should help me win without overpaying.' In round 4, all the submitted bids were 28,18,22. Your value was 23. And you bid 22.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 8. Your total profit is 9 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 23, I will bid 22 to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I make a profit. This bid is slightly below my value, which helps minimize the risk of overpaying if I win the auction.' In round 5, all the submitted bids were 34,32,18. Your value was 19. And you bid 18.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 4. Your total profit is 9 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 19, I will bid slightly below my value to ensure that I still make a profit if I win the auction. By bidding 18, I aim to win the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, considering the second-highest bid will determine my payment.' In round 6, all the submitted bids were 12,22,12. Your value was 13. And you bid 12.  Your profit was 0 and winner's profit was 12. Your total profit is 9 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 13, I will bid slightly below my value to ensure that I still make a profit if I win the auction. By bidding 12, I aim to win the prize while minimizing the risk of overpaying, considering the second-highest bid will determine my payment.' In round 7, all the submitted bids were 25,27,33. Your value was 34. And you bid 33.  Your profit was 7 and winner's profit was 7. Your total profit is 16 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'My value for the prize is 34, so I will bid 33 to maximize my chances of winning while ensuring I make a profit. Given that previous bids have varied widely, bidding just below my value should help me win without overpaying, considering the second-highest bid will determine my payment.' In round 8, all the submitted bids were 17,16,18. Your value was 19. And you bid 18.  Your profit was 2 and winner's profit was 2. Your total profit is 18 \\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Since my value for the prize is 19, I will bid slightly below my value to ensure that I still make a profit if I win the auction.
