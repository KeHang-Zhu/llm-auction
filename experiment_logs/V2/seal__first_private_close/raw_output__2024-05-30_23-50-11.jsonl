At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction.
