Every number between 0 and 20 is equally likely to be drawn.\nIn each round, your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private adjustment. At the start of each round, you will learn your total value for the prize, but not the common value or the private adjustment.\nThis means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, when you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.\nThe auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then you can choose a bid in the auction. Each person in your group will submit their bids privately and at the same time. \nAll bids must be between 10 and 90, and in 1 USD increments.\nThe highest bidder will win the prize, and make a payment equal to their bid. This means that we will add to her earnings her value for the prize, and subtract from her earnings her bid.
