            "### Plan for Next Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **Enhanced Moderate Bidding**: Adjust the moderate bidding strategy to bid 75-85% of my value instead of the previous 70-85%, to minimize the potential of undercutting myself.\n2. **Targeted Aggressiveness**: Only employ aggressive bidding (90-99% of value) when my value is above 70, to cautiously assess competitiveness without excessive risk in lower-value rounds.\n3. **Strategic Randomization**: Use randomized bidding for 1 out of every 5 rounds to disrupt opponents' ability to predict my behavior and gather data without too much inconsistency.\n4. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop quick models based on observed bidding patterns of Betty and Charles, incorporating their average bids and standard deviations to make more informed bids.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **Role of Value Perception**: Bidders tend to handle high values (>70) more competitively. Use high-value rounds for aggressive bidding to maximize potential profit for winning.\n2. **Opponent Behavior**: Betty and Charles seem consistent; structuring bids as counter-strategies to their common bidding ranges (e.g., Charles consistently bids lower) could be beneficial.\n3. **Profit Analysis**: Understand that securing the win when values are extremely high brings significant profit even when bid percentages are high. Low-value aggressive bids are riskier and often yield minimal profit.\n4. **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Capturing and analyzing bid data after each round will refine these strategies, emphasizing predictive accuracy over purely randomized approaches in future rounds.\n\nBy implementing these refined strategies and insights, I anticipate improving my overall profit through strategic adaptability and informed decision-making.",
            "### Plan for Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. **Aggressive Bidding:** Continue to bid 80-90% of my value when my value exceeds $50, but monitor closely if this leads to consistently high profits or losses. \n2. **Incremental Bidding:** Increase incrementally by $1-$2 when my value is between $25-$50 rather than $20-$50, as low values might not competitively engage the other bidders.\n3. **Randomized Bidding:** Continue randomizing bids between 50-70% for values under $50, to maintain unpredictability and gain data on opponents' responses.\n4. **Cutoff Strategy:** Keep the $99 bid for values above $90 to ensure a win with high-valued prizes, but implement only if the value is exactly $99 to avoid possible high losses.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n- **Aggressive Bidding:** Can lead to substantial gains when the value-to-bid ratio is managed correctly, but risky as it can also result in high losses.\n- **Incremental Bidding:** Useful for trapping cautious bidders, especially those who hesitate to increase their bids significantly.\n- **Randomized Bidding:** Effective in maintaining unpredictability, likely causing opponents to misjudge my bidding pattern and make errors.\n- **Cutoff Strategy:** Guarantees wins with maximum-value items, but should be applied sparingly to avoid significant potential losses if outbid.\n\nBy balancing aggression and caution, and analyzing outcomes diligently, I can refine these strategies for higher long-term profits.",
            "### Plan for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. **Plan for Round 1**:\n   - Apply the **Aggressive Bids** strategy: Since my value was high (79) in the last round but my bid was conservative (39), I will bid closer to my value, aiming for 70-80 if my value is above 50 to secure the win.\n\n2. **Plan for Round 2**:\n   - Implement **Reactive Bids** by analyzing the bids of Andy and Betty in Round 1 and adjusting accordingly. If they consistently bid high, I'll bid around 5-10% higher than my initial strategy calculation.\n\n3. **Plan for Round 3**:\n   - Use the **Value-Driven Bids** strategy: Bid my value divided by 2 to see how effective a balanced approach is, adjusting for any changes in their bidding behavior observed in Rounds 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Plan for Round 4**:\n   - Test the **Randomized Bids** strategy: Bid randomly between 50% and 100% of my value to test unpredictability and gather diverse data points.\n\n5. **Plan for Round 5**:\n   - Apply **Conservative Bids**: Bid slightly above the average of Andy and Betty's bids from previous rounds to avoid overpaying while staying competitive. \n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Historical Analysis Importance**: Reviewing Andy and Betty's past bids is crucial for the **Reactive Bids** strategy. Patterns in their bidding can inform optimal adjustments.\n2. **Aggressive Strategy Rationale**: With high values, bidding closer to the actual value increases the probability of securing the prize, especially when the value is over 50.\n3. **Value-Driven Benefit**: This initial strategy will help establish a baseline comparison for more complex strategies.\n4. **Randomization to Avoid Predictability**: Randomized bids serve as a useful test to check if being unpredictable confuses the other bidders and results in more wins.\n5. **Balancing Risks and Rewards**: Conservative and value-driven strategies minimize risk but may sacrifice wins, while aggressive bids maximize chances of winning but could reduce net profits if the value is low."

            "### Plan for Next Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **Enhanced Aggressive Bidding**: For values above 90, bid between 95-98 to ensure high-value wins. Maintain high aggression for maximum returns.\n2. **Fine-Tuned Mid-Range Bids**: For values between 60-89, bid initially at 70-75% of the value and adjust upwards in 2-3 point increments if competition tightens.\n3. **Conservative Low-Value Bids**: For values between 30-59, bid at 20-25% of the value to avoid overcommitting resources.\n4. **Strategic Random Bidding**: Every third round, make a completely random bid between 0-99 to disrupt prediction models of other bidders.\n5. **Opponent Response Analysis**: Continuously monitor Betty and Charles' bids for patterns, increasing bid amounts dynamically based on observed trends.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **High-Value Aggressiveness**: Aggressive bids for high values have consistently produced profitable results, validating this approach.\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: Charles exhibits conservative bidding, indicating low risk-taking, while Betty employs variability to introduce unpredictability.\n3. **Mid-Range Strategies**: Successful mid-range bids should start at 70-75% of the value, with incremental adjustments ensuring competitiveness.\n4. **Impact of Randomization**: Introducing random bids can effectively disrupt opponent strategies, preventing them from predicting our moves accurately.\n5. **Continuous Learning**: Dynamic adaptation based on round outcomes is essential to stay ahead. Regularly analyzing and adjusting bids based on Betty and Charles' behaviors will enhance long-term profit.",
            "### Updated Plan for Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **High-Value Aggressive Bidding:** For values above $80, bid between 75-85% of your value. This ensures a strong chance of winning without overcommitting.\n\n2. **Moderate-Value Balanced Bidding:** For values between $50-$80, bid around 65-70% of your value. This balances competitiveness and risk.\n\n3. **Low-Value Conservative Bidding:** For values below $50, bid 50-55% of your value. Minimize potential losses while maintaining some level of competitiveness.\n\n4. **Competitor Pattern Analysis:** Analyze competitor bids every two rounds, identifying if they tend to overbid or underbid, and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n5. **Risk Adjustment:** Add a small variability to bids (\u00b15%) to stay unpredictable and harder to counter.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies\n\n- **Aggressive When Prized:** High values necessitate aggressive bids for large profits, but balance is key to avoid losses.\n- **Balanced Approach:** Mid-range values require balanced bidding to avoid excessive risk while staying competitive.\n- **Conservatism:** Lower values should have conservative bids to protect against unfavorable win-bid scenarios.\n- **Adaptation:** Regular review and adjustment based on competitor behavior are crucial for sustained success and maintaining a competitive advantage.\n- **Unpredictability:** Introducing bid variability enhances unpredictability, making it harder for competitors to develop effective counter-strategies.",
            "### Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. **Plan for Round 14**:\n   - **High-Value (70-99)**: Bid at **70-80%** of the value to balance competitiveness with caution.\n   - **Mid-Value (30-69)**: Bid at **45-60%** to remain competitive while mitigating risk.\n   - **Low-Value (0-29)**: Bid at **5-15%** to minimize losses and gather participation data.\n\n2. **Plan for Round 15**:\n   - **High-Value (80-99)**: Aggressively bid at **75-85%** to challenge upper limits of opponent bids.\n   - **Mid-Value (50-79)**: Bid at **55-65%** to gauge how opponents react in this competitive mid-range.\n   - **Low-Value (0-49)**: Place bids at **5-10%** to minimize losses while collecting data.\n\n### Insights:\n\n1. **Adaptive Bidding**:\n   - Adjust bids based on observed opponent patterns. For instance, if Andy consistently bids high, place slightly lower bids to avoid direct competition while remaining strategic.\n   \n2. **Aggressive Testing**:\n   - Higher bids in high-value rounds help identify opponents' bidding limits, thereby refining future strategies for maximum profit.\n\n3. **Resource Conservation**:\n   - Use conservative bids in low-value rounds to preserve resources. Focus aggressive tactics on high-value rounds to maximize potential returns.\n\n4. **Opponent Behavior**:\n   - Counter Andy\u2019s high bids and Betty\u2019s mid-range bids by positioning bids to exploit their tendencies. Regularly monitor and adapt to ensure increased win rates and optimized profit margins."
