            "To maximize long-term profit, I will test the following bidding strategies: 1. Bid my exact value to secure high-value wins. 2. Place slightly lower bids (5-10% below) than my value to avoid overbidding and still remain competitive. 3. Use aggressive bids (1-2% above my value) to test opponents' willingness to bid high. 4. Compare outcomes from bidding close to the second-highest observed bid in previous rounds to optimize profit margins. 5. Occasionally place very low bids to gather data on other bidders' behavior and their typical bidding ranges. Adjust strategy based on observed patterns.",
            "To maximize long-term profit, I'll test several strategies. First, I'll begin with conservative bids around 60% of my value (~37) and gradually increase to 80% (~50) across a few rounds to gauge competitors' average bids. Next, I'll experiment with aggressive bids above my value to test profit margins and opponents' flexibility. Concurrently, if I notice patterns in opponents\u2019 bidding, I'll adapt by shading just over their observed values. Finally, I will keep an eye on ties and adjust to strategically place bids for random wins. I\u2019ll analyze which strategy yields higher profits overall.",
            "Start with conservative bids at around two-thirds of the prize value to gauge other bidders' tendencies. Increase aggressiveness by bidding closer to my full value when competition is weak. Occasionally place very low or very high (near $99) bids to observe reactions and gather data. Track bids and outcomes to identify patterns. Adapt strategy based on learned behaviors, split between conservative (~70% of value), moderate (~80% of value), and aggressive (~90%+ of value) bids. Use aggressive bidding if previous rounds show consistent low competition, with adjustments for chance and opponent styles."

Insights regarding bidding strategies:\n   - Bidding near the second-highest observed bid from previous rounds can secure wins while optimizing profit margins.\n   - Slight underbidding can help balance winning probability with overbidding risks.\n   - Random very low bids can uncover valuable information about regular bidding ranges of competitors.\n   - Adaptation and unpredictability are key in preventing competitors from anticipating and countering my strategies effectively.",

Future Bidding Strategies: a) Given a value of 40, I will bid 60 (approx. 1.5x of my current value) to test riskier strategies. b) In subsequent rounds, when my value is low (below 50), bid between 50% to 70% of my value to conserve potential profit. c) For higher values (above 70), I'll bid around 80% and 90% of my value to evaluate middle-ground competitive strategies. d) Occasionally bid near the maximum ($99) for extreme responses in understanding opponent thresholds. \n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights: a) Increasing my bid moderately in small increments can help identify precise winning thresholds. b) Balancing between aggressive and conservative strategies ensures risk management. c) Observing the second-highest bid gives an insight into effective bid above the median values. d) Consistent adaptations based on competitors\u2019 previous bid tendencies can assist long-term strategy refinement. e) Randomly high or low bids are integral for data-gathering but must be balanced to avoid consistent loss."
