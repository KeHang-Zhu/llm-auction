            "Next, I'll test a few key strategies. First, bid slightly below my value to assess the competition\u2019s aggression. Second, if my value is between $50 and $70, I\u2019ll bid aggressively ($70-$90) to see if high-risk moves deter opponents. Third, when my value is above $70, I'll experiment with incremental bids starting at $50. Finally, for values below $40, I'll test conservative bids (below $30) to preserve long-term profits. By varying my approach across rounds, I can better understand opponents' behaviors and uncover the most profitable bidding patterns.",

Observing the outcomes will help refine future tactics based on opponents' patterns and competition intensity.",
            "I plan to start with aggressive and high bids to gather data on my competitors' bidding patterns. I will vary my bids based on my value each round. If my value is high (over $70), I'll bid close to my value. For moderate values (between $40-$70), I'll bid slightly below my value (around 75%). For low values (under $40), I'll bid conservatively (around 50%). I'll also occasionally make very low or very high bids regardless of my value to test competitors' reactions. This mixed approach will help identify optimal bidding behavior and exploit tendencies of other bidders for long-term profit maximization."
