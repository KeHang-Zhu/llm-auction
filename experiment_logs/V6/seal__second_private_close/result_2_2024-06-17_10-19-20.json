            "1. **Exploration Phase:**\n   - Bid randomly within 10-20% below my value for several rounds to gauge the typical bids from Betty and Charles.\n   - Experiment with a few lowball bids (10-20% of my value) to potentially win low-value auctions.\n\n2. **Aggressive Bidding:**\n   - Test aggressive bids close to but not exceeding my value to determine if it successfully deters competitors.\n\n3. **Risk Management:**\n   - Bid my exact value when the value exceeds $70 to avoid paying more than the prize is worth.\n   - Place slightly higher bids (around $5-10 more) when my value is mid-range ($40-$69).\n\n4. **Learning from History:**\n   - Adjust strategy based on opponents\u2019 patterns \u2013 if Betty usually bids 80% of her value, increase my bids strategically.\n\nThrough this process, I aim to balance between risk, aggression, and cautious bidding to optimize long-term profit.",
            "1. **Initial Mid-Range Strategy:** Start bidding around 40-60% of my given value to assess the other bidders' aggressiveness. \n\n2. **High-Risk High-Reward:** Occasionally bid close to my value to gauge extreme bidding behavior and potential wins.\n\n3. **Incremental Adjustment:** Gradually increase or decrease my bids based on the previous round's highest and second-highest bids to find an optimal range.\n\n4. **Observation & Adaptation:** Monitor Andy's and Charles' patterns to predict future moves and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n5. **Random Low Bids:** Occasionally place very low bids to see if they result in unexpected wins or discover conservative bidding patterns.\n\n6. **Data Analysis:** Continuously track and analyze all bids and outcomes to refine strategies over time.",

            "### 1. Future Bidding Strategies:\n\n**Exploration Phase:**\n1. **Continue Random Bidding:** Maintain the strategy of bidding within 10-20% below my value for the next 3 rounds to gather more data on Betty\u2019s and Charles\u2019s bidding behavior.\n2. **Lowball Bids:** Experiment with bids at 10-20% of my value, especially if my value falls below $50, to maximize profits on low-value items.\n\n**Aggressive Bidding:**\n1. **High-Value Aggression:** If my value exceeds $90, bid 90% of my value to test competitors' reactions while minimizing potential loss.\n2. **Mid-Value Adjustments:** For values between $50-$80, increase my bid by $5 more than my previous strategy ($5 above 50-69 range) to test if higher bids deter competitors without exceeding my value.\n\n**Risk Management:**\n1. **High Value Adjustments:** Test bidding my exact value only if it exceeds $80, reducing my threshold from $70, to further ensure profitability.\n2. **Mid and Low-Range Caution:** For values under $50, maintain low bids to minimize losses in losing scenarios.\n\n**Learning from History:**\n1. **Pattern Recognition:** Keep a detailed log of Betty\u2019s and Charles\u2019s bid percentages relative to their values and adjust my bids upwards by 5% when confident patterns emerge.\n\n### 2. Insights:\n\n1. **Opponent Behavior:** Initial observations suggest Betty and Charles may not always bid close to their values, hinting at cautious or conservative strategies. Testing slightly higher aggressive bids may deter them.\n2. **Value Sensitivity:** Bidding closer to my exact value when it exceeds $80 ensures that I avoid overpaying for high-value items while maximizing potential gains.\n3. **Risk Mitigation:** Keeping bids low in low-value scenarios reduces the potential for significant losses, crucial for long-term profit maximization.\n4. **Dynamic Adaptation:** Continuously adjusting strategies based on opponents' behavior will remain crucial for maintaining profitability, balancing between aggressive and conservative bids based on observed bidding patterns.",
            "### Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. **Moderate Risk Strategy:** Adjust bids to be within 60-70% of my given value. This range is relatively high but not overly aggressive, aiming to strike a balance between exploration and conservatism.\n   \n2. **Adaptive Threshold:** Identify average winning bid amounts by analyzing past data. Use this average as an adaptive threshold for future rounds, bidding slightly above this value to increase chances of winning.\n\n3. **Predictive Adjustment:** If there\u2019s a pattern in Andy\u2019s and Charles\u2019 bids (e.g., steady increments or decrements), adjust my bids to counteract their likely moves. \n\n4. **Strategic Low Bids:** On occasional rounds with low value prizes, place an extremely low bid (e.g., $1-$10) to test if Andy and Charles are consistently high bidding, allowing me to preserve capital for higher-value rounds.\n\n5. **High-Risk Test Round:** In every 5th round, place a bid equal to my value to capture a comprehensive understanding of maximum bids in the game, even if it might result in a temporary loss.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. **Aggressiveness of Competitors:** Previous rounds indicate that at least one competitor is highly aggressive (e.g., bidding $90). Therefore, placing very high bids strategically might be necessary occasionally to secure wins.\n\n2. **Second-Highest Bids:** It's essential to track the second-highest bid, as this determines the cost of winning. A substantial gap between the highest and second-highest bids can indicate inefficient bidding by the competitors.\n\n3. **Bid Distribution:** From the previous round, bids are significantly spaced (90, 40, 37), suggesting at least one conservative bidder. This offers opportunities to experiment with bids in the 40-60 range for potential wins.\n\n4. **Behavioral Patterns:** Monitor for periodic bidding behaviors or predictable patterns from Andy and Charles. Any detectable pattern can be exploited by adjusting bids accordingly.\n\n5. **Capital Management:** A balance between high-risk and conservative bids can help preserve my capital, especially when the value of the prize is low. Such an approach can optimize long-term profit.\n\nBy employing these diverse strategies and continuously filtering through the collective data of past rounds, I aim to enhance my bidding efficiency and maximize long-term profit.",
            "### Plan for Bidding Strategies\n\n1. **Data-Gathering Phase (Initial Rounds)**\n   - Continue placing bids at half of my value for an additional 2 rounds to gather more data about Andy and Betty\u2019s strategies and bid ranges.\n\n2. **Analysis and Adjustment (Early to Mid Rounds)**\n   - Review collected data on Andy and Betty\u2019s bids. Identify if they are more inclined towards higher or lower bids.\n   - If no clear pattern emerges, start bidding at 60% of my value for the next 3 rounds to test their reactions.\n\n3. **Intermediate Phase (Moderate Strategy)**\n   - Based on gathered data and observed patterns, adjust bids to 75% of my value for the next 4 rounds to strike a balance between winning and conserving resources.\n\n4. **Endgame Strategy (Aggressive Phase)**\n   - Identify the highest average bids of Andy and Betty. \n   - Place bids at 90-95% of my value for the remaining rounds if it\u2019s a must-win situation, adjusting slightly above or below my value as necessary.\n\n5. **Adaptive Bidding**\n   - Continuously monitor the outcomes of each round and fine-tune the percentages (60% to 95%) as required, in response to new data.\n\n### Insights on Bidding Strategies\n\n- Bidding half of my value in initial rounds minimizes losses and provides a clear picture of opponent strategies.\n- Moving to 60-75% of my value gradually increases my chances of winning as I gauge the average bid values.\n- Aggressive bidding (90%-95%) should be reserved for later rounds, particularly if the competition exhibits higher consistent bids.\n- Flexibility and real-time adjustments based on opponent behaviors are critical to outsmarting the competition.\n- Understanding bid tendencies can reveal if opponents prefer low bids to conserve or high bids to secure wins, allowing for strategic exploitation.\n"
