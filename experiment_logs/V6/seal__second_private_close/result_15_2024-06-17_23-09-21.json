            "I will initially place moderate bids (around 50% of my prize value) to gauge opponents\u2019 behavior. If other bidders are aggressive, I\u2019ll adopt a more conservative approach to avoid overbidding. If they are cautious, I\u2019ll increment bids aggressively (about 70-90% of my value). Occasionally, I will test random high bids regardless of my value to collect data on opponents' responses. Each round's outcomes will inform adjustments, seeking patterns in Betty and Charles' bidding strategies. The goal is to balance risk and reward, optimizing long-term profit through adaptive strategies.",
            "I will test several strategies to gather a wide range of data. First, I'll test aggressive bidding by bidding my entire value for the prize (value bidding) to gauge competitor behavior. Next, I'll try moderate bids by consistently bidding 75% of my value. I'll also test underbidding strategies by bidding 50% of my value when my value is high, and a fixed bid (e.g., $30) regardless of my value. Lastly, I'llexperiment with random bid values to assess unpredictability's effectiveness. I'll alternate these strategies, track outcomes, and adjust based on competitor patterns and performance trends.",
            "My next plan involves testing a mix of aggressive and conservative bidding strategies. First, I'll bid my value minus $10 if my value is above $50, to test if high bids can secure profits by paying less than my actual value. Second, if my value is less than $25, I'll bid conservatively at $5 to gather data on low-bid effectiveness without much risk. Lastly, for mid-range values between $25 and $50, I'll bid approximately half my value plus $10 to test a balanced approach. This strategy mix aims to maximize data gathering for future rounds."
