            "To optimize long-term profit, I will adopt a mixed strategy approach:\n\n1. **Randomized Bidding**: I'll use a random number generator to dictate some bids to understand how unpredictable bidding influences outcomes.\n2. **Aggressive Bidding**: In a few rounds, I'll bid close to my value to see if high aggression deters competition.\n3. **Moderate Bidding**: I'll try bidding around 70-80% of my value to balance risk and reward.\n4. **Reactive Bidding**: Analyze previous bid patterns of Betty and Charles to adjust bids dynamically, staying just above their recent bids to win by narrow margins.\n\nThis will help gather diverse data for analyzing profitable patterns.",
            "To maximize long-term profit, I'll test diverse bidding strategies. First, I'll try a \"value minus risk buffer\" approach, where I'll bid my value minus a specific percentage (e.g., 10-30%) to gather data on opponent behaviors. This lets me adjust to avoid overbidding. I'll also apply the \"threshold\" strategy, bidding incrementally just above the previous second-high bid to win at minimal extra cost. Finally, testing aggressive bids near my value will help understand opponents' maximum bids. Analysis from these tests will refine my tactics. Adjustments each round will aim to optimize returns by balancing risk and reward.",
            "I will test a varied bid strategy to gather data and improve profit maximization. Initially, I'll bid 70% of my value to balance winning chances and potential gains. Then, I'll experiment with aggressive bidding, such as 90% of my value, to understand rival behaviors and opportunities. In parallel, I'll test conservative bids at 50% of my value to see how often rivals overbid. Reviewing the previous rounds for trends, I'll adjust my strategy dynamically, aiming for optimal profit while mitigating potential losses from rivals' patterns and tendencies.\n\n"

            "Since I won the auction with a lower bid (8) previously, I need to adjust my future strategy based on value variations and opponent behavior:\n\n1. **Aggressive Bidding Strategy:** If my value is high (e.g., above 60), I'll bid closer to my valuation, around 70-80. This aims to secure the win despite potential high bids from Andy or Betty.\n\n2. **Moderate Bidding Strategy:** For mid-range values (30-59), I'll bid slightly conservatively but competitively, in the 40-50 range, to balance risk and reward.\n\n3. **Exploratory Strategy:** For low values (below 30), experiment with sub-20 bids to gather insight into others' bidding habits.\n\nMonitor results and adapt accordingly."
