Analyze all bid outcomes to refine these strategies.",

In subsequent rounds, I'll alternate between conservative bids (e.g., $40-$50) and moderate bids ($60-$65) to observe Andy's and Betty's bidding patterns. Tracking their responses will help identify their thresholds. Must carefully note wins, losses, and their bids to refine strategies. Will experiment with occasional low bids ($20-$30) to continue data gathering on risks without high losses. This combined approach will help balance risk and reward while gathering comprehensive data for optimal long-term profits."

Insights: Observing past rounds, bidding too high can lead to losses even if we win due to high cost. Bidding just above the average second-highest bid often maximizes profit.
