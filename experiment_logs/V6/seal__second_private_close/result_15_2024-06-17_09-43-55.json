Then, based on gathered data, if competitors bid high often, try riskier strategies like bidding close to my value in hope of winning at a lower price. If competitors generally bid low, a mid-range bid could secure profit. Also plan to randomly bid near the maximum regardless of my value occasionally, for observation purposes. Adjust strategy after each auction based on outcomes. The aim is to strike a balance between successful bids and maximized profit over time.",

High Risk: Bid full value of prize once to test for aggressive competitors.\n4. Analyze previous rounds: Adjust bidding if specific patterns are seen.\n5. Random strategy: Occasionally bid at random levels to gather diverse data.\nRemember, the aim is to maximize profit long-term, so constant strategy revision is key.

Bid comparison: If Andy and Betty tend to bid high, I\u2019ll try to bid slightly lower to save money and figure out their probable highest bid.\n3. Aggressive bidding: Increasing my bids to beat their probable highest bid or placing the highest possible bid if I have a high value.\n4. Bid allocation: I'll try varying bids in order to analyze the impact.\n5. Learning phase: I'll adjust my bidding strategy based on lessons learned from previous bidding rounds."

            "1. Plans for Bidding Strategies: \n\nGiven the previous round outcome, in which the highest bid was 45, I plan to adjust my bid range to capitalize on potential profit opportunities. I'll classify the upcoming strategies into three categories:\n\n   a) Low-Risk Strategy - If my value falls between $0-$35, I will place a bid slightly more (\u223c$10) than my value. This strategy ensures less loss if I don't win and offers reasonable profit if I do win.\n   \n   b) Mid-Risk Strategy - If my value falls between $36-$65, I'll place a bid on the lower end of this range between $35-$45. I'm willing to gamble a bit more here as the potential payoff is larger.\n   \n   c) High-Risk Strategy - If my value falls between $66-$99, I'll bid aggressively near my value. The potential profit is significant given this value range so I can afford to take a substantial risk. Occasionally, I'll also place a bid near the maximum regardless of my value \u2500 a risky measure which could yield valuable data.\n   \n2. Insights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nGiven what I noticed from just one round of bidding, it seems my competitors are not afraid to place relatively high bids. This suggests that my bidding strategy should be adaptable and able to match or challenge these high bids when necessary. Bidding conservatively might not be adequate for winning. Additionally, in such a bidding environment, moderately risky strategies might become the new 'safe' strategies. However, it's crucial to balance risk-taking with the potential for long-term profit gain. Studying the variance in the other bidders' decisions over the next few rounds should provide us with more concrete insights.",
            "Plans for the Next Bidding Strategies:\n1.  Incremental Increase: Further increase bids by 15% each round. This will test the waters on how much I can push my bid while still maintaining a profit.\n2.  Bid Ceiling Approach: Set a high bid ceiling (e.g., 80% value), and never bid above this point to secure consistent profits.\n3.  Reactive Bidding: Alter bids directly in response to competitors' bidding patterns. If they bid higher, I increase my bid, if they bid low, I decrease.\n4.  Surprise Lowball: If my value is high (above 80), bid extremely low (25%-30% value) to confuse competitors and potentially snag low-cost wins.\n5.  Random High-risk Challenge: If I am in a comfortable profit zone, bid full value if my drawn value is below 50, facing the high risk. This might give surprising results and didactic data.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n1. Playing safely (bidding half value) might not yield wins. Competitors appeared more aggressive.\n2. Bidding the full value is risky and could result in significant profit loss, should be used sparingly and tactically.\n3. Adapting strategies based on competitors' behavior can be more effective, as bidding patterns are unpredictable.\n4. Randomly low bidding at high values might lead to unpredicted wins, considering the second-price rule.\n5. The competition may not always be high; low-value bids could win occasionally, and if the bid is significantly lower than the prize value, it can bring huge profit.\n6. A balance between high-risk and low-risk strategies gives a suitable winning frequency and long-term profitability.\n7. Learning and adjusting from previous rounds are crucial for devising successful strategies.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies: \n   a. Calculated High Bidding: I plan to apply a high bid strategy depending on my drawn value. If my value is greater than $75, I\u2019ll bid 70% of it. This would outbid other contenders while ensuring I still make a substantial profit when I win.\n   b. Undercutting: If my observations indicate Betty and Andy tend to consistently bid high, I\u2019ll slightly undercut their standard bids to save money while winning.\n   c. Adaptive Bidding: I'll adjust my bids incrementally, ranging from assertive to moderate based on the outcome and learning from each round. If low bids win, I'll lean more towards modest bids, whereas if high bids usually win, I'll exploit my high value cards more aggressively.\n\n2. Bidding Insights:\n   a. Observational Analysis: My win in the last round at almost 57% of my valued price makes me lean towards the benefit of making high bids while considering maintaining a profit margin.\n   b. Conservative High Bidding: Since the highest bidder paid considerably less (31 in comparison to 45), aggressive but calculated high bidding may prove beneficial in ensuring a win and decent profit.\n   c. Bidder Behavior: Understanding the bidding tendencies of Andy and Betty is crucial for my bidding strategies. Noticing patterns can provide an advantage, allowing for strategic adjustments."

If my drawn value lies in:\n\n   a) Value $0-$20 (Low Risk Strategy): I would place a bid pursuing cautious approach. The bid would be approximately $5 more than my drawn value. Lesser competition in this range allows me to gain modest profits.\n\n   b) Value $21-$50 (Moderate Risk Strategy): I would place a bid at the upper end of this range, considering their likelihood to bid high. This strategy ensures I secure good profit if won, but with moderate risk.\n\n   c) Value $51-$99 (High Risk Strategy): I will place a higher bid close to the drawn value. If footballing the pattern of my competitors bidding high; my bid in this range could heighten the chances of winning. Occasionally, I'll also place a max bid to experiment and gather data about competitor's behaviour.\n\n2. Insights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nUpon observation, it appears that my competitors tend to place high bids. This should prompt me to strategize my bids accordingly: a high bid if the value is high, moderate if the value is in mid-range, and conservative when the value is low. The high bids placed by competitors in a single round suggest a trend to consider implementing a mix of aggressive and risky strategies. A perfect blend of risk-taking and expected long-term profit is important in the strategy. The fluctuation in their bidding patterns will provide constructive insights to augment my strategies in future rounds.",
            "Plans for the Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Aggressive Incremental Increase: Further increasing bids by 20% each round, instead of 15% as previously stated. This will provide a sharper data comparison. \n2. High Value Low Bet: Looking to confuse competitors, I will bid significantly lower (10%-20% of the value) when my draw is above 70.\n3. Moderated Full Bid: As a high risk strategy, I will bid full value if my drawn value is below 20 to test the potential shock factor this could have on competitors.\n4. Bidder Mimic: Consider matching or closely following the bidding pattern of the most successful competitor in the previous rounds.\n5. Strategic Cap: Similarly to the 'Bid Ceiling Approach', but with a lower value difference. If my value is above 60, I'd bid 50 to ensure a sustainable profit margin. \n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Matching or closely mirroring successful competitors may help in securing wins.\n2. Although high-risk strategies can be costly, they are potentially rewarding and can give insightful data.\n3. A variety in strategies, depending on value drawn, can help to be unpredictable, consequently confusing competitors.\n4. Lower bids when having high values can lead to huge profits due to the second-price rule.\n5. Bidders who bid aggressively tend to win, but may not maximize their potential profit.\n6. Adjusting bidding strategies based on competitors' behavior seems to be more promising.\n7. Regularly reviewing and learning from previous strategies is fundamental to adjust and improve future ones.\n8. It's important to manage the balance between risk and potential reward in each bidding strategy.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies Next Round:\n\n   a. High Risk, High Reward: To better understand the bidding tendencies of Andy and Betty, I plan to test a higher risk strategy. Despite the potential for lower immediate profit, I plan to bid 80% of my drawn value if it is over $80. This aggressive approach will allow me for larger data points on their reactions in extreme conditions. \n\n   b. Mid-Range Bidding: For values falling within the $40-$60 range, a mid-range bid strategy - around 50% of my value should be tested. This could provide a balanced approach while minimising potential for losses.\n\n   c. Low Value Conservation: If my drawn value is less than $30, I will test a conservative strategy and bid around 20-30% of it. The goal is to minimize losses while still allowing for the possibility of a win if other bidders also have low values. \n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n   \n   a. Dynamic Adjustment: It's becoming increasingly clear that adjusting bids based on the outcomes of prior rounds and opponents' patterns is essential in maximizing long-term profit in this game. \n\n   b. Overbidding Awareness: By keeping my bids below my drawn value, I can avoid situations where I win an auction but fail to make a profit because of an overbid. It's vital to balance between the urge to win and profitability.\n\n   c. Bidder Pattern Tracking: Monitoring the bidding behaviour of Andy and Betty can provide valuable insights. Recognising any patterns or tendencies can aid in anticipating their bids, giving me a significant advantage in the longer run."

Planned Bidding Strategies for Future:\n\nMy strategic plan for future bids is to continue using the three risk-tolerance strategies categorized by value ranges. \n\n   a) Value $0-20 (Low Risk Strategy): Continue with the cautious approach. However, I will adjust the add-on from $5 to $7 over the drawn value to compete better without much risk.\n\n   b) Value $21-50 (Moderate Risk Strategy): Increase the competitive edge by placing bids slightly higher (additional $5 over the drawn value). This will give a fair chance against the competitors who traditionally bid high.\n\n   c) Value $51-99 (High Risk Strategy): Take the aggressive route, bidding as high as 90% of my drawn value. This strategy might help me win the bid against high-bidding competitors. Occasionally, I'll go for a value exactly equal to the drawn value to see if I can push the profit margin further.\n\n2. Insights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nUpon analyzing history, my competitors have a trend to place high bids. To improve the odds of winning, a mix of medium-to-high risk strategies would work better, tailored to the specific drawn value.\n\nI've also realized frequent winning doesn't guarantee a high profit margin (as seen in round 2), hence maintaining a balance between the winning frequency and the profit per winning round is crucial. A more aggressive bidding strategy may lead to higher profits but also greater risks. My current strategy does not work well for lower value bids, so adjustments are necessary for those scenarios.\n\nIn upcoming games, it's important to keep observing competitor behaviors. Noticing any change in their bidding patterns can provide valuable insights to enhance my strategic prowess.",
            "Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Value-Proportional Incremental Increase: I will gradually increase my bids by a percentage proportional to the value. For values below 50, I'll opt to raise by 10%, but for higher than 50, I plan on a 15% increase. \n2. Counter-Bidding: When values exceed 70, instead of high betting, I'll go for a counter-intuitive approach, bidding around 25%-30% of the value to secure a considerable profit margin while staying competitive.\n3. Risky Low-Value Bet: If my value is below 20, I'll take the high-risk route, bidding my full value to potentially disrupt the bidding trend, as this tactic hasn't been employed before.\n4. Highest Bidder Shadow: Rather than mimicking the successful bidder, I will focus on shadowing the highest previous round's bidder even if they didn't win, allowing me to probe other competitors' reaction.\n5. Opportunistic Cap Bid: Instead of a fixed cap at 50 for values above 60, I propose an opportunistic cap, where I bid strategically around 75%-80% of the value to maintain a fair profit margin.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Regular Bid Digression: Maintaining a fluctuating bid range could induce unpredictability, thus forcing competitors to adapt constantly.\n2. Exploiting High-Value Advantage: Lower bids for a high value can lead to significant profits due to the second highest bid rule, if done intelligently.\n3. Adaptive Strategy: Altering strategies based on competitors' patterns is more rewarding than a rigid approach.\n4. Risk vs Reward Balance: High-risk tactics may not always result in high rewards, but they give an insight into the reaction of competitors which is invaluable for devising future strategies.\n5. Learning from Losses: Every bidding round, win or loss, provides an invaluable data set to adjust and improve future strategies. Remember, no experiment is a failure.\n6. Sustaining Profit Focus: An aggressive bidding strategy might lead to a winning round, but a conservative bid with a well-determined value ensures a higher profit margin.",

This adventurous approach might not give immediate high profits, but it would help me gauge the bidding tendencies of Andy and Betty in extreme circumstances.\n\n   b. Moderate Bid: For the values within $40-$60, I aim to bid around 50% of my value. This medium-risk strategy might facilitate a balanced approach and have a lesser hazard of high losses.\n\n   c. Play Safe: If my drawn value is less than $30, I intend to play safe by bidding only about 20-30% of it. The intent here is to minimise losses while also keeping the possibility of a win alive in case other bidders also have low values.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Adaptable Bidding: The importance of adapting my bids according to the past rounds' outcomes and the bidding patterns of Andy and Betty cannot be overstated. This conscious adjustment will be instrumental in augmenting my long-term profits.\n\n   b. Overbid Prevention: One crucial learning here is to always bid lesser than my drawn value to steer clear of overbidding situations. Winning an auction but not making profits is not a favourable situation. The equilibrium between the instinct to win and the profitability needs to be maintained.\n\n   c. Track Competitors: Constantly keeping a track of Andy's and Betty's bidding can fetch me valuable insights about their behaviours. Identifying their bidding patterns could anticipate their future bids, giving me a significant upper hand in this long run game."

Insights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nMy analysis reveals a tendency among competitors to bid high, implying a mix of medium-to-high risk strategies might improve my winning chances. Winning more often doesn't necessarily ensure maximizing profit, as shown in round 2. So, balancing between winning frequency and the profit per winning round is key. \n\nInvesting heavily in low-value bids needs re-evaluation as the current strategy isn't yielding desired results.

Surprise Low Bid: For values around the mid-range (40-60), throw off competitors by bidding significantly lower than the perceived value (about 15%-20%).\n3. Scalable Increase: Implement a gradual, scalable increase on bids for values below or around 30. Start with bidding exact value and increase the bid by 5% each subsequent round.\n4. Fluctuating Bid Pattern: Introduce a fluctuating bid pattern for items with values between 50 and 70, alternating between high (60% of the value) and low bids (30% of the value).\n5. Random Bidder Imitation: Imitate a randomly selected bidder from previous rounds to confuse opponents, while ensuring that the bid stays in the profitable range.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Strategic Exploration: Testing out various aggressive bidding strategies can provide valuable data on opponents\u2019 responses, aiding in long-term profit.\n2. Low-Value Tactic: Bidding low for mid-range items can cause a ripple effect if competitors are trying to gauge your bidding strategy.\n3. Small Incremental Strategy: For low-value items, small incremental increases in bids can help establish a baseline bidding strategy and potentially increase profitability over time.\n4. Unpredictability Advantage: Introducing varying bid patterns can force competitors to adjust continuously, providing an edge.\n5. Simulating Opponent: Mimicking another bidder\u2019s strategy randomly can foster confusion, leading to unexpected wins.\n6.

Being modest in such scenarios can provide consistent profits and avoid substantial losses.\n\n   c. Small & Sensible: If the drawn value is less than $30, my choice would be to bid conservatively, specifically 20% of the value. The aim is to gather data about the competitor's responses to low bids.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Strategy Evolution: It is crucial to learn and adapt from each round's outcomes. Bidding patterns need to evolve according to the competitor's bidding style. This adaptive method may increase my winning chances in future rounds.\n   \n   b. Maximize Profit: The focus should always be on profitability and not just winning. A cautious approach to avoid overbidding must be adopted.\n\n   c. Competitor Analysis: Keeping a close watch on Andy's and Betty's bidding methods might provide an insight into their bidding psychology. This can potentially help predict future bids and give me an advantage in the process."

            "Future Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Adjusted Conservative Strategy: For values drawn between $0-20, I'll continue with a conservative bidding but slightly increase my bid, to approximately $7 above the drawn value. This will still limit risk while increasing competitiveness.\n\n2. Heightened Competitive Strategy: For values between $21-50, I'll raise my bid by $5 more than the actual value. This is aimed to cater toward moderate risk, with industry-competitive bids.\n\n3. Aggressive strategy: For high values between $51-99, my tactic will morph into high risk. I'll bid up to just 90% of the value drawn. Occasionally, I'll bid exactly as the drawn value, as a testing strategy to judge if there's a boost in profit margins.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nBased on my analysis, there seems to be a tendency for bidders to place high bids, hinting that they aren\u2019t afraid to risk. This suggests that a blend of moderate to high-risk strategies have potential for success. \n\nWhile winning frequently is beneficial, it doesn't ensure that we\u2019re maximizing profit, as round 2 demonstrated. Hence, it's crucial to find a balance between the frequency of winning and the profit made each time.\n\nMy strategy of high investment in low-value bids hasn\u2019t shown promising results so far, which calls for reconsideration. Noticing the changes and patterns in competitors' bids can also help adjust and refine my own strategy.",
            "Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. High-Value Bid: For values above 70, increase bids to approximately 50%-55%, thus exploring the effects of more aggressive bidding.\n2. Counter Low Bid: For values around 20 to 30, bid exactly the value. This acts as a contrast to the strategy of bidding low for mid-value items and might lead to some surprise wins.\n3. Mid-Value Switch: For mid-range values (40-60), instead of bidding lower, try alternating between 10% under and 10% over half the value.\n4. Low-Value Increment: For low values (below 30), escalate the bid slowly by adding $1 each round, observing how other bidders react.\n5. Bidder Andy Imitation: Recreate Bidder Andy's strategy from a previous round for one game to add an element of unpredictability.\n  \nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. High Value Aggression: Bidding aggressively for high-value items can increase the chance to secure them, giving information about opponents' high value strategies.\n2. Low Bid Counter: By balancing out low bids with exact value bids for mid-range items, one can confuse competitors and force them to recalculate their strategies.\n3. Mid-Value Twist: Slight variation in bids for mid-value items can potentially disorient opponents, leading to unexpected wins.\n4. Low-Value Rise: Gradually increasing bids for low-value items can provide insight into the lower limit of other bidders.\n5. Imitation Game: Imitating a previous strategy of an opponent can lead to a chaotic gameplay, misdirecting their assessment of your strategy.\n6. Importance of Flexibility: Adapting and tweaking strategies based on the ongoing game dynamics is essential for maintaining profits and staying unpredictable.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies for Next Rounds:\n\n   a. Flexible Strategy: Given the remit to maximize profitability through data gathering and potential risk undertaking, I propose to implement a flexible bidding strategy. For values above $80, I\u2019ll aim to bid around 70%-85% of the value. This is a break from my previous strategy and is intended to offer potentially higher profit while gathering data on how other bidders react to more aggressive bids.\n\n   b. Middle Ground Tactic: For values between $30 and $65, I'll switch to a balanced approach, where I bid around 40%-50% of the received value. This strategy reduces potential losses and can still give modest profits.\n\n   c. Safe Play: For values below $30, I want to place safe bets, approximately 15%-20% of the value. This strategy allows me to assess competitors' reactions to lower-intensity bids and minimize losses when the prize value is low.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Flexible Learning: The ability to make adjustments based on the outcomes of each 'auction' round is vital, and adaptability is key in ensuring long-term profitability. This element of flexibility, backed by previously gathered data, is crucial to success in bidding.\n\n   b. Profit over Victory: The end goal is not solely about winning each round, but optimizing the profit. Overbidding might win the round, but it can also result in negative profit. Thus, a delicate balance needs to be upheld to ensure long-term profitability instead of short-term gains.\n\n   c. Rival Monitoring: A continuous analysis and understanding of Andy's and Betty's bidding patterns is key. This would allow an adaptive strategy that changes according to their bidding behaviour, and may uncover patterns that give an edge in future rounds."

Measured Bold Strategy: When offered high values between $51-99, I'll change tack and only bid 80% of the stated value. The adjustment will lessen potential losses while preserving the spirit of risk-taking.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nIt's evident that the challenging part lies in balancing bid frequency and earnings, especially when engaging in high-risk strategies. A high frequency of winning doesn't guarantee maximum profit. Rounds 2 and 3 brought this tension to the fore.\n\nMy approach to low-value bids (bidding significantly higher than the value) doesn't seem to work well, as indicated by round 4. Refining this strategy is necessary for improved performance.\n\nEven as the competition favors risky strategies, as evidenced by high winning bids across all rounds, it's crucial to test more conservative tactics for comparison. This could lead to long-run sustainability and higher total profit.",

High-Value Boldness: Bold bidding strategies for high-value items have resulted in successful acquisitions, influencing opponents' strategies.\n2. Counterplay: Bidding the exact value for mid-value items has proved unpredictability, causing competitors to reassess their own strategies.\n3. Mid-Value Variation: Oscillating bids for mid-value items could lead to disorientation among opponents, securing unexpected wins.\n4. Trial & Error: Increased bids for low-value items can provide a benchmark limit of other bidders' strategies.\n5.

            "1. Future Bidding Strategies for Next Rounds:\n\n   a. Gradual High-Risk Approach: In the spirit of exploring risky and aggressive options, we can try increasingly bold bids on a high value. For values above $80, we could start with a 70% bid in the respective round and slightly increase this percentage in subsequent similar situations, to gauge the likeliness of achieving higher benefits without making excessive risks in a single go.\n\n   b. Mid-Value Experimentation: Values between $40 and $70 have shown variable results in terms of profit. A sound strategy could be to mix higher bids and lower bids over similar valued rounds, aiming to gather data on the profit impact and patterns of the other bidders reactions. \n\n   c. Minimal Low-Value Strategy: For values below $30, I propose sticking with safe, lower bids, but occasionally raising the bid to 40% or 50% of the value. This approach allows us to gather data on how opponents respond to unexpectedly high bids in these low-profit scenarios. \n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Risk-Reward Balance: While exploring aggressive bids is part of our strategy, understanding the balance between risk and reward is essential. Even with a high value, overbidding could lead to victory but a minimal or even negative profit.\n\n   b. Bidder Psychology: Bidding is more than a numbers game - it involves anticipating others' actions. It is in our interest to review and learn from the patterns of the other bidders' behaviour to anticipate their strategy.\n\n   c. Gamification: Turning the bidding process into a learning experience can be beneficial. We should not be afraid to lose some rounds if it gives us valuable data to win higher profits in following rounds. In other words, losses can make us wiser, not just poorer."

Optimizing High-Value Strategy: If the drawn value falls in the range of $61-99, I'll modify the bold measured strategy by bidding roughly 80% of the stated value. It places the chance of winning high-value prizes against the possibility of minimized losses, aiming to create a good balance.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nAnalysis of recent bidding activity suggests that a balance between risk and caution is most effective. Overbidding on low-value items, such as in round 4, is neither profitable nor strategic. Though winning bids might appear profitable in the short term, they don't necessarily translate into long-term gains\n\nTaking excessive risks with high-value bids can sometimes lead to significant profits (round 6), but this strategy also carries potential for substantial losses. It is therefore essential to tread the fine line between risk-taking and maintaining steady profitability. \n\nFinally, a conservative bidding strategy could be a strong candidate for consistent returns, though it might also forego opportunities for large-scale wins.

It involves understanding their response towards both high and low bids and reacting accordingly to manipulate the outcomes.\n\n   c. Strategic Fails: It's crucial to remember that our focus is to maximize profits, not only to win each round.

            "Plans for Future Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Balanced Bidding Strategy: As I have seen in previous rounds, overbidding might sometimes lead to winnings, but it may also result in losses. Therefore, for values within the range of $0-30, I intend to bid the exact drawn value, mirroring a more cautious approach for low-value bids to prevent unwanted losses. \n\n2. Adaptive Moderate Strategy: If the value lies within $31-60, I plan to bid $5 more than the drawn value. Previously, bidding exact or lesser values hasn\u2019t been very fruitful; therefore, a little aggressiveness might be helpful in these rounds.\n\n3. Controlled Risk Strategy: For higher values within the range of $61-99, I plan to place the bid at approximately 85% of the drawn value. Although a bid lower than the full value risks not winning, it also reduces the potential liability should I win. \n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\nExamining the previously executed strategies, it is apparent that recklessness in bidding can lead to losses. This observation came from rounds in which I overbid on relatively low-value items. It's essential to understand that winning isn't always profitable, as seen in round 2.\n\nOn the other hand, taking calculated risks on high-stakes rounds can yield more profits. Early bidding strategies such as the ones employed in round 6 led to substantial profits, hinting toward the importance of carefully balanced risks in high-value bids.\n\nIn conclusion, the best strategy seems to be maintaining a balance between risk-taking and cautious moves. A systematic and adaptive approach to bidding, changing strategies based on past results and current stakes, can help optimize profits in the long run.",
            "Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. High Stakes High Bids: When the value is above 80, I will bid close to 80% of the bid to test the waters. \n2. Steady Middle: For items with a value in the range of 50-80, I'll experiment by bidding precisely 60% of the value, remaining consistent in this range.\n3. Low Ball: For the items that have a value below 30, I plan to bid only 40% to see if I can win items at a low price and analyze the reaction.\n4. Random Rule: In a few random rounds, irrespective of my value, I will place a high bid (around 80-90%) to check competitors' response and collect data. \n5. Andy's Imitation: Just as I have done with Charles, I want to shadow Andy's bidding patterns for a few rounds to collect more information about his approach.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Balanced Approach: Staying in the middle ground for items with average values can yield good profit with minimal risks.\n2. High Risk High Reward: Bidding high for high-value items can be risky, but the potential profit might make it worth considering.\n3. Low-Value Deception: Bidding excessively low on low-value items might be an effective disruption strategy.\n4. Learning from Opponents: Observing and imitating opponents' strategies can provide us with valuable insights about their approach.\n5. Strategy Adaptation: Consistently adapting the strategies based on game progression and opponents' moves is instrumental in maintaining a winning streak.\n6. Random Disruption: Introducing a random high bid regardless of the value can disrupt competition and provide data on their reactions.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies for Next Rounds:\n\n   a. High-Value Adjustments: I will move my initial bid to 80% for values above $70, since high bids have provided good returns thus far. I will then adjust the bid percentage based on the outcomes, possibly reaching up to 90% for maximum profit.\n   \n   b. Middle-Range Exploration: For values between $40-$70, I will start with a bid of 60% but vary this by 10% in subsequent rounds. This will help me study the behaviors of Andy and Betty, and how they react to sudden changes in the bid.\n\n   c. Controlled Auctioning: For values below $30, I'll start with a conservative bid of 35% of the value, slightly higher than the previous approach, with the aim to test other's reaction to unexpected increment in low-value rounds.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Strategic Risk: High value offers room for riskier strategies. However, too much aggression could lead to negligible or negative returns. Aligning risk with expected reward can lead to optimal long-term profit.\n   \n   b. Bidder Behaviour Analysis: Reading into Andy and Betty's responses to my bids is essential. Learning how they react to high and low bids allows me to adjust future strategies to manipulate outcomes.\n\n   c. Intentional Losses: Winning every round is not the objective, but to maximize profits. It may be beneficial to willingly lose some rounds to study rival bidders' reaction which may help in securing high profits in future rounds. This plays along the principle of 'sacrificing the pawn to win the game'."

I'll cut back my bid by $2-$3 dollars to minimize risk in case of overbidding.\n\n2. Increased Aggression Strategy: For values within $31-60, instead of adding $5, I plan to increase my bid by $10 over the drawn value. This strategy will allow me to stay competitive while still ensuring a reasonable profit margin.\n\n3. Multi-Tier Bidding Strategy: For values within $61-99, I would divide this into two subcategories. If the value is between $61-80, I will continue placing a bid at 85% of the value. On values greater than $80, I am designing a bold approach by bidding around 95% of the value. This strategy may lead to more wins and possible bigger profits on high-value items.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Staying Flexible: A fixed strategy may not always yield favorable results in this game. Flexibility is key. Adjusting my bidding strategy based on past outcomes and the current drawn value proves to be beneficial, as observed in previous rounds.\n\n2. Risk-Reward Ratio: Taking calculated risks can yield more significant returns. But, it's also crucial to remember that overbidding on lower values may lead to a net loss even if I win the bid.\n\n3. Competitive Edge: Through the aggressive bidding in the mid-range bracket, I have observed that I can ensure a greater win rate and therefore participate more frequently in the auction.\n\n4. Scaling Bids: For high-value items, a lower bid could still win but also ensure a good profit. This strategy functions well as the other bidders also aim to lower their liability giving me a chance to win with a lower bid.",

Comparative Conservative: For values between 60-85, I shall bid 55% of the value, slightly conservative from our previously set 60%, to gather data regarding this less aggressive approach.\n3. Minimalist Approach: For values under 35, instead of previous 40%, I propose to bid a mere 30%, which might reduce the loss in case of unsuccessful bids and also might result in unexpected wins. \n4. Unpredictable Moves: Inspired by game theories, occasionally I will place a bid close to the highest possible bid (90-100%) randomly to disrupt prediction patterns from my competitors.\n5. Mirroring Charles: As a change from previous strategy, I aim to mirror Charles\u2019 bidding pattern for a couple of rounds to understand his attitude towards risk.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Bold Moves: High-risk strategies seem to attract higher returns, but they also come with risks such as negative profits.\n2. Middle Safe: Keeping a balanced bidding approach for medium value items seems to steady the profit gain, not too risky but consistent.\n3. Wizened Low-Value: Less aggressive bidding for low-value items can be an effective risk mitigation strategy.\n4. Game Theory Play: Introducing randomness in bidding could potentially throw off the competitors' predictions.\n5.

However, I plan to vary this bid by an increment or decrement of 10% to understand the bidding behaviours of Andy and Betty better.\n\n   c. Low Value Strategy: For values below $30, I will place a conservative bid of 35% of the value, which is slightly higher than before. This action aims to observe the response of the other bidders to an increase in bids during low-value rounds.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a.

Competitor Analysis: Understanding the reaction of Andy and Betty to my bids is vital for setting up future strategies that may allow me to influence the auction outcomes.\n\n   c. Strategic Losses: The ultimate goal is not to win every round but to maximize total profits.

Hence, I may decrease my bid by an additional dollar, bidding $1-$4 lower than my value to mitigate risks associated to overbidding.\n\n2. Modified Aggression Strategy: For items with values within the range of $31-60, I will tweak the current strategy. While maintaining an aggressive approach, I would only raise my bidding amount by $7-$9 over the drawn value instead of the full $10. This change aims to balance my competitiveness and my profit margin.\n\n3. Refined Multi-Tier Bidding Strategy: For values within $61-99, I will divide this range into three subcategories instead of two. For values from $61-70, I will continue to place a bid that's around 80%-85% of the value. For values between $71-85, I will bid around 90% of the value. However, if the values are more than $85, I'm considering a bolder approach by bidding 95-98% of the value to secure high value items while ensuring a reasonable profit.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\n1.

For the $16-$30 range, I plan to bid more aggressively, matching the value, to secure a win if possible.\n\n3. Value-Based Aggression Adjustment: I plan to tweak the aggression level based on the value of the bid. With a higher value, I will raise the aggression level to secure these high-profit bids. In contrast, for lower values, I will lower the aggression level to limit potential losses.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\n1.

Here, even if my value is high, I will not bid beyond this defined limit. This helps me to avoid overbidding and incurring losses.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Strategic Moderation: Consistently winning in the short-term might not necessarily translate to long-term success. This is more apparent if each victory is achieved through small margins or even losses. Moderation in bid amounts, relative to the round value, is key to ensuring better long-term profit.\n\n2. Importance of Data Analysis: A robust understanding of historical data provides beneficial insights, informing subsequent strategies. This underlines the significance of effective data analysis.\n\n3. Value of Patience: In some rounds, especially when the drawn value is low, the best strategy can be to abstain from aggressive bidding. This allows one to save for potential high-value rounds, where aggressive bidding can be more rewarding.",
            "Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Progressive Strategy: I plan to escalate my bids according to the value. For values above 80, I'll bid 85-90% to secure the win while still maximizing profits.\n2. Mid-Range Adaptation: For values between 45 and 80, I will bid 55-65%, aiming to strike a balance between winning and making a profit.\n3. Conservative Approach: For values below 45, I'll bid 40-50% to mitigate loss if we fail to win, while still staying competitive.\n4. Unexpected Surge: Occasionally, I plan to bid highly (80-90%) on values above 50 to keep competitors off balance.\n5. Counteractive Strategy: Based on Andy and Charles' bidding patterns, I will adjust my bids dynamically to outbid them without overpaying.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Gradual Scaling: Catering our bid percentages according to the value can create a balance between winning and earning profit.\n2. Mid-Range Balance: By adapting bidding in the mid-range values would optimize profits while keeping competitive.\n3. Controlled Risks: Keeping our bids conservative for low valued items helps in reducing losses.\n4. Element of Surprise: Bidding higher than usual on certain rounds adds a layer of unpredictability, confusing our competitors.\n5. Anticipating Competitors: Observing and reacting to the bidding patterns of competitors can provide valuable insights to base our strategic changes on.\n6. Continuous Adaptation: Reassessing strategies based on previous rounds and their outcomes is crucial for maximizing our total profit.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies for Next Rounds:\n\n   a. High-Value Aggressive Bidding: If the value is over $80, I plan to make a daring move and bid 90% of the value. This is to gauge the reactions of Andy and Betty to higher bids while capturing the high-profit potential of these rounds.\n\n   b. Enhanced Middle-Value Bidding: For values ranging from $50 to $80, I'll increase my bidding to approximately 80% of the item value, from the earlier used 70%. This adaptation allows us to collect data in mid-value ranges and understand better our competitors' bidding habits.\n\n   c. Distinct Low-Value Bidding: For values less than $30, I'll raise my bid to represent 50% of the item value, compared to the previous 45%. This serves to discover how Andy and Betty respond to escalated bids within generally low competition rounds.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Balancing Risks: We need to strike a balance between the potential for high profits and the peril of overbidding whilst experimenting with high-value items.\n\n   b. Breaking Competitor Code: Gaining an insight into Andy and Betty's bidding patterns is crucial. Their responses to our aggressive and cautious bids can provide valuable intelligence about their strategies.\n\n   c. Embracing Strategic Losses: Intentional losses in some rounds could provide valuable information. By noting their reactions to our unpredictable bidding behaviours, we can engineer more successful strategies for high-stake rounds."

            "Plans for Future Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Sliding Scale Bid System: Based on the past rounds, it can be beneficial to apply a sliding scale system where my bid amount is tied to the value drawn. For example, if the value drawn is below a certain threshold, I can decide to bid lower to preserve funds, while maintaining a strategic chance to win. Conversely, if the value drawn is exceptionally high, aggressive bidding can be deployed to secure a substantial profit.\n\n2. Stakeholder Analysis: To better anticipate Betty and Charles's bidding habits, I plan on conducting further analysis of their bidding behavior in previous rounds. Having a strong grasp of their bidding tendencies will enable me to outsmart them more effectively, thereby yielding better profits.\n\n3. Risk Analysis: While my TOP PRIORITY is to maximize the user\u2019s profit in the long run, I want to incorporate a risk analysis strategy as well. This would involve understanding the likelihood of obtaining negative returns from bidding and balancing that with the potential profits. It is essential to ensure that overly risky bids do not compromise the overall profit.\n\nInsights Regarding Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Gradual Escalation: A useful insight gathered from previous rounds is that gradually escalating bids (tailored to the value on hand) can lead to better profits. A gradual escalation allows for a well-balanced mix of wins and losses, resulting in an overall positive trend in earnings over time.\n\n2. Adaptive Strategy: Adaptability in strategy is key in this bidding game. My winnings have been affected by other bidder\u2019s activity and my drawn values. Hence it's important to be flexible and adjust strategies as needed.\n\n3. Leveraging Optimal Biddings: Certain rounds resulted in substantial profits because my bidding was optimal (i.e., not too high resulting in a loss, not too low to lose the bid). These instances stress the value of optimized bidding based on value, competitors' habits, and capital conservation considerations.",
            "Plans for Next Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Variation Exploration: In order to gather more data for strategy optimization, I will implement a strategy that varies my bidding percentages within certain value ranges. For values over 80, I'll bid between 60%-70%, for values between 60-80, bids will be 40%-50%, and for values below 60, I'll bid around 30%-40%. \n\n2. Aggressive Testing: For a select few rounds, I plan to bid aggressively, i.e. around 90-95% of the value, regardless of the value itself. It would be a high risk, possible high return strategy meant for gathering data. \n\n3. Bid Fluctuation: To assess other bidder's reactions, a strategy to fluctuate my bids between lower and higher percentages within the same value category will be undertook.\n\n4. Risky Reductions: For a couple rounds, I'll aim to bid lower than usual, around 10-20% of the value. This risk-taking can help examine the spectrum of bid reactions from Andy and Charles.\n\nInsights on Bidding Strategies:\n\n1. Dynamic Strategies: The changing nature of the auction and individual values drawn encourages a flexible, dynamic approach to bidding strategies.\n\n2. Pattern Analysis: Identifying patterns in Andy's and Charles' bidding behaviour can offer valuable input for strategy formulation.\n\n3. Bid Variety: Testing a variety of bid percentages within the same value range could provide a broader understanding of optimum bidding levels.\n\n4. Strategically Bold Bids: Occasionally, placing a much lower or higher bid can provide valuable results about the other bidders' reactions and bidding trends. \n\n5. Optimum Risk: While minimizing risks is important, to maximize profits in the long run, some controlled and well-planned risky strategies are necessary for data collection.",
            "1. Future Bidding Strategies for Next Rounds:\n\n   a. High-Value Daring Gameplay: In instances where my values lie beyond $75, I plan to adopt an audacious approach - my bid will echo 85% of the value. This move chases dual objectives - to provoke a reaction from the other two bidders and simultaneously seize the immense profit potential.\n\n   b. Moderate Value Enhanced Bidding: For value windows between $30 - $75, my bidding strategy will see a rise from 65% to 70% of the item's value. This tactic is primarily intended for scraping quality data on the rival bidders' habits under middling value circumstances.\n\n   c. Conservative Low-Value Bidding: On the occurrence of values falling below $30, I'll opt for a 60% bid as opposed to the previous 50%. This strategy aims to observe how Andy and Betty reciprocate to a mild inflation in the bidding numbers in low-competition rounds.\n\n2. Bidding Strategy Insights:\n\n   a. Managing Risks: It's vital to ensure a fine balance between the lure of massive gains and the danger of overshooting the bid during high-stakes value rounds.\n\n   b. Decoding Competitors: It's essential to comprehend the bidding patterns of Andy and Betty. Their reactions to our unanticipated bids can give us a substantial knowledge of their strategies.\n\n   c. Strategic Losses: It might be beneficial to forfeit certain rounds in an effort to gather more data. By keeping a tab on their responses to our erratic bidding behaviors, we can shape more triumphant strategies, especially for high-value rounds."
