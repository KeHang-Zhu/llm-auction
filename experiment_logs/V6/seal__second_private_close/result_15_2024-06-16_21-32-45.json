I'll try and bid closer to my expectation of the second highest bid, taking into account the previous bids trends, to maximize profits. Also, in scenarios where my value is lower, I'll experiment with unusual or risky bidding patterns, to understand competitor response and gather data. Improved risk assessment and trend analysis will allow me to refine this approach over time.",

The idea is to balance between winning, making a profit, and testing a slightly aggressive approach to collecting data for future rounds. Furthermore, I'll observe Andy and Betty's bidding range to inform my strategy."
