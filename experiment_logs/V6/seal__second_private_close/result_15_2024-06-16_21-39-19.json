When the value is low, under 20, I'll explore minimal bids to save on loss. For data gathering, I'll attempt varying strategies in different rounds to widen my understanding and adjust accordingly.",
            "Given that I have won all rounds, my current aggressive strategy seems effective. I should continue adjusting my bid in respect of my drawn value (around 70-80% of the drawn value). In the next few rounds, I plan to test a moderate approach, lowering my bid of this percentage range when my value is high (above 65). I will also observe competitors\u2019 patterns for any predictability. Nevertheless, I will not shy away from taking calculated risks when necessary. Random low bids could occasionally be introduced to try and exploit high profit margins."
