Additionally, I may experiment with minimum bid increments or a \"bluffing\" tactic, to confuse my competitors and observe their reactions. This strategy, although risky, would provide critical data for future rounds. I'll also periodically reassess my strategy based on ongoing outcomes."

Test different strategies even with potential short-term loss; beneficial data could provide long-term profit.",
            "Plan: For values $0-25, retain the bid at 30-40% as this range is less competitive. For values $25-50, bid aggressively around $45-55. If value is $50-75, slightly increase bid to 70-80%. For values >$75, exploit high return by bidding $85-$95. Occasionally place very high/low bids for gauging competitors' response. Continuous assessment of competitors' bidding tendencies is necessary for adaptive planning. Aggressively strive for the lead, but consider risks and rewards balance."
