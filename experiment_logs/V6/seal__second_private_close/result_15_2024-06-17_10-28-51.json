            "Plans: Building on my initial approach, I will continue implementing a combination of different bidding strategies in the upcoming rounds. This will include bidding in the medium range ($26-$50) when my value is lower, and utilizing a high bid ($51-$75) for rounds where my value is higher. Additionally, I stand to take more risks with a very high bid ($76-$99) whenever I detect a trend toward aggressive rival bids. \n\nInsights: From the previous round, winning the auction with a bid of 75 while competing against considerably lower bids suggests that the other bidders are less aggressive. This implies that a balanced approach between moderate to high bidding might maximize profit in future rounds, as it seems to deter overly competitive bidders. It will be vital to monitor if this pattern continues to adjust bidding strategies accordingly. Regular outcome evaluations will maintain flexibility in my overall process.",
            "Plan: Based on the limited information gathered in round 0 and the strategies outlined, here are the plans to test next:\n\n1. High-Risk Bidding: Increase the bid to 70-80% of my value in the upcoming rounds. The aim is to see if the risk of bidding higher could potentially yield larger profits.\n\n2. Lowest Bidding: Bid the minimum dollar amount on a few rounds, regardless of the value, to examine if there's any gain in this surprisingly low bid.\n\n3. Analytical Bidding: Based on the outcomes and trends observed from previous rounds, adjust my bid amount strategically.\n\nInsights:\n\n1. In round 0, the winning bid was very aggressive, indicating a potential high-risk strategy on the part of the competitors.\n\n2. My conservative strategy with bidding at 50% of my value did not yield any profit. This suggests rethinking the conservative approach.\n\n3. Pay attention to opponents' tendencies, as both Andy and Charles will also change their strategies based on round feedback. Predicting their strategy could provide an edge. \n\n4. Future rounds must factor in these learnings to modify or tweak these outlined strategies for maximum profit.",
            "Plans: The last round depicted a wide gap between highest and second-highest bidders which indicates a potential for aggressive bidding. For the next rounds, I will increase my bids to about 40-50% of the values, then observe the pattern in winners and their profits. If I notice consistent high bids, I may stage mid-range bids to avoid potential overbiding. I will experiment with bids closer to my maximum value occasionally to gather additional data. I'm also considering the possibility of zero bids to understand competitors\u2019 reaction to it.\n\nInsights: Observation from the previous auction reveals that high-risk bets may bring bigger profits. However, these need to be balanced against potential losses from unsuccessful bids. Understanding opponents' bidding style is key, specifically identifying if they consistently go high or low. This can provide the basis for deciding my bidding strategy. Learning about the reactions to different bids: high, mid-range, and low, can guide the development of well-rounded strategy. Persistence in exploring different strategies is necessary to decipher which works best."

Depending on the outcome, I may occasionally place zero bids to reevaluate competitors response, which will be informative in situations with low values.\n\nInsights: The competing bidders seem open to high-risk, high-reward strategies, as evidenced by the broad gap between the top two bids. While this could lead to significant gains, it also poses potential downsides in the event of unsuccessful bids. It is crucial to balance exploration and exploitation in bidding. A versatile strategy that considers the competitors' bidding habits, reaction to different bid levels (high, mid-range, low), and the overall frequency of winning bids is essential. Furthermore, persistence and adaptability in adjusting bidding strategies is key to achieving long-term profitability."

This dual strategy will allow me to further understand the strength of the opponent's bidding and adapt accordingly. Also, I'll explore the gambit of bidding half of my value to add an element of unpredictability in my strategy.\n\nInsights: The key insight from the previous rounds is that opponents tend to bid high. This signifies a risk-prone attitude, which can be capitalized by placing a strategically lower or equal bid. However, the unpredictability of my opponents' bids calls for a versatile strategy. It's notable that the gap between the highest and second-highest bid varies significantly, suggesting that calculated risks may fetch higher returns.

Simultaneously, I will introduce an element of uncertainty by putting forward a few very low bids on high drawn values to test my opponents' responses. I aim to gather data on rival bid patterns through this method to create an optimized bidding strategy.\n\nInsights: The success of aggressive bids in past rounds, especially in cases with a large value difference, suggests rivals might also be testing different strategies, causing bid variability. I noticed a trend of incredibly high bids yielding high returns, indicating rivals possibly overestimate their values. Each round appears independent; thus, predicting bids solely based on previous performance might not guarantee success. To capitalize on this, I plan on switching my bids often instead of sticking strictly to one approach.

            "Plans: Experiencing a streak of losses directly influences my strategy; thus, implementing an additional action plan is fundamental. Following my current rule, if I lose three consecutive auctions, I will decrease my bid percentages by 10% in the upcoming round. However, for high-value scenarios (>$70), I will explore a more aggressive 90% bid strategy, banking on the likelihood of substantial returns compared to losses. For mid-range values ($30-$70), I will probe a wide range of bids from 50% to 75% to test the waters on this category. Low-value situations (<$30) still seem delicate, hence keeping a high bid percentage of 90% for data gathering.\n\nInsights: Tailoring the bidding strategy to my value and past performance is critical in this dynamic environment. Increasing the bid for high-value scenarios seems promising despite the associated risk. The middle value remains unpredictable, thus more data gathering on this spectrum is needed. Additionally, it's evident that consistency in winning is not always equivalent to maximum profit due to second-price rules. Seeking a balance between efficient wins and profitability remains the priority. Lastly, a reactive strategy towards competitor's behavior optimizes the chances of profit maximization.",
            "Plan:\n\n1. High-Value Experiment: With items above $70, I'll move to bid 80% of my valuation, dropping from 95%, to see if the increase in cushion outweighs any potential losses.\n\n2. Medium-Value Shift: For items valued between $50 to $70, I'll increase to a 70% bid as our 65% strategy hasn't been successful. \n\n3. Low-Value Change: With items below $50, I'll maintain 50% bidding, due to the consistent unsuccessful result of previous lower bids.\n\nInsights:\n\n1. High-Value Optimization: It\u2019s possible to increase profits by reducing bids for higher-value items; the gamble is the risk of losing them to another bidder.\n\n2. Flexible Bidding: Shifting our strategies in response to changing circumstances is vital, especially for medium-value items where the competition is stiffer.\n\n3. Low-Value Risks: Raising bids for lower-value items may seem counter-intuitive, but it's a necessary risk to gather data and possibly realize profit.\n\n4.

I will base this on my value, previous winning bid and my opponents\u2019 tendencies. I'll bid closer to my value when it's high (>70), to exploit the potential for high profits, since higher bids have been successful recently. When my value is low, I'll bid conservatively to minimize loss. I will also begin to bid significantly lower than my value (approximately half the amount) for a couple of rounds to observe the reaction of my opponents.\n\nInsights: The successful bids in the past rounds have demonstrated some patterns. High bids have a tendency to succeed, implying a possibility of aggressive bidding behaviours by my opponents. However, consistency seems elusive. The variance in the bidding strategy by my opponents suggests unpredictability, highlighting the need for adaptability. Lower bids have helped me get a positive profit in rounds where my values were average. Hence, a mix of both high-risk and conservative strategy depending on my value could be beneficial. Observing opponents' reactions to a sudden drop in bid could provide useful insights for subsequent rounds."

High-value situations will remain aggressive at 90% regardless of streaks, given the substantial returns. Low-value scenarios will continue at 90% to reduce risk but will be adjusted if losses persist.\n\nInsights: The auction results unveil the complexity of bidding strategy in such a dynamic and competitive environment. Notably, consistent winning doesn't necessarily correlate with maximum profit due to the second-price rule. Hence, the focus is on striking a healthy balance between winning frequency and profitability. Now, high-value strategies appear to be profitable, but mid-value bids demand further investigation.

Specifically, if my value is above 70, I will bid in high range (60-70) to potentially win with a significant profit margin. If the value falls between 30 and 70, I will bid about half of my value to minimize losses and potentially garner a modest profit. However, if the value is below 30, I'll bid conservatively, around $1-$5 to preserve my capital while gathering data on opponent reactions to low bids. I'll also maintain sporadic high-risk bids to keep opponents guessing.\n\nInsights: The unpredictability in my opponents' bidding behaviour suggests the need for fluidity in my own strategy. Bidding close to my value when it's high has resulted in substantial profits, and conservative bidding has proven useful to collect profits from moderate values. With low values, it seems beneficial to bid extremely low and utilize these rounds to gather data rather than aiming for profit. Lastly, surprising the opponents with occasional risky bids might destabilize their strategies to my own advantage."

In cases where my value is below 40, a cautious approach with bids ranging from $1-$10 depending on the value is still prudent. Finally, I plan to introduce random high bids in low and medium value categories to confuse opponents and to gather data.\n\nInsights: A key take-away from the past rounds is the necessity for constant adaptation. For high values, bidding closer to the value has been profitable in overwhelming the competition. With medium values, my previous strategy seems to be inadequate to score a win, indicating the need for higher bids. In low value rounds, the conservative approach allows for minimal risk while gaining insight on opponent behaviour. Still, introducing unpredictable elements such as random high bids in low and medium value categories may disorient opponents' strategies."

For low-value rounds beneath 40, I will opt for slightly higher bids in the 10-20 range to increase my chances of winning. Incorporating an element of unpredictability, I'll introduce occasional aggressive bids during low and medium values for confusion and data-gathering purposes.\n\nInsights: Progress demands continuous adjustment of strategies. A pattern that has emerged from previous rounds is that higher bids are often more successful in high-value situations. For medium values, my adjusted strategy hasn't worked as well as expected, hence a further increase in bidding percentage is worth testing.

            "Plan:\n\n1. Refined High-Value Bidding: If my drawn value is above $70 this time, I will bid up to 98% of that value, a slight increase from the previous 96%. This is to push the envelope on how high we can safely go while still reaping a profit.\n   \n2. Mid-Range Strategy: For values in the range of $30-$70, I am planning to bid around 65% of the value, a 10% increase from the previous strategy. This increment is anticipated to make us more competitive in this range.\n\n3. Conservative Low-Value Bids: If the value is below $30, I'll continue to bid 55% of my value in order to minimize losses and collect more data regarding the lower range.\n\nInsights:\n\n1. Profit-Maximizing Ratio: The percentage of my bid versus my value seems to be key in winning auctions and maximizing profit. High-value items require a higher bid, while low-value ones need a more conservative approach.\n\n2. Constant Revision: The fluctuating nature of bid values from others underscores the importance of constant strategy evaluation and revision. \n\n3. Risk Awareness: Aggressiveness in bidding has its merits for high-value items, but we always need to evaluate whether the potential profit justifies the risk.",
            "Plan: Based on previous rounds, an aggressive bidding strategy yields higher profits in high-value situations (values above 70), therefore I aim to continue with this approach, increasing my bid range to 85-90% of my value. For middle range values (40-70), I'll adjust my strategy to a bid range of 75-80% of my value due to low win rate with previous strategy. For low values (under 40), I will attempt risky bids within a 40-50% range, rather than the previously chosen lower value, to outbid competitors while maintaining a marginal profit.\n\nInsights: It's evident that a dynamic bidding approach is critical for holistic success considering the ever-changing auction environment. High-value draws demand aggressive bidding, while mid-range values may necessitate a semi-aggressive approach. Taking calculated risks in low-value rounds may yield unexpected returns and useful data. Remaining observant of competitors' strategies and being adaptable will be crucial for long-term profit optimization. Balancing between risk and reward, while remaining unpredictable to other bidders, may prove to be the optimal long-term strategy."

            "Plan: Based on previous rounds and considering I'm tasked with exploring riskier strategies for long-term gains, I will further adjust my strategy. If my value is above 80, I will bid around 97% of my value, pushing from the previous 96% to gain a competitive edge. For the mid-range values of 30-70, I will bid within the widened 65%-85% of my value, offering a slightly more conservative approach in response to recent losses. For values below 30, I'll continue bidding closely to the value. Additionally, after losing rounds, instead of dropping down 5%-10%, I'll incrementally increase my bid by 3%-5% to test an opposing strategy to see whether it brings rewards.\n\nInsights: The aggressive strategy has yielded mixed results, with profits indeed achieved during high-value rounds but with losses in the mid-range. It appears that moderate aggression may be more suitable within mid-value auctions to avoid unnecessary losses against stiff competition. I've noted a trend developing - mildly aggressive bids tend to yield disproportionately better results. This could be a strategy worth considering for long-term profit maximisation. Additionally, one-off high bids are seemingly effective and may catch opponents off guard. Lastly, round-to-round adaptability appears crucial for sustained winnings.",
            "Plans:\n\n1. Revisiting High-Value Bids: For items above $70, I'll bid up to 95% of the value. The slight decrease is in response to previous unsuccessful rounds despite aggressive bidding. \n\n2. Adjustable Mid-Range Strategy: Increasing competitiveness for $30-$70 items, I'll bid within 70-80% of the value. The range provides flexibility and allows data collection on optimal bidding percentage.\n\n3. Low-Value Safeguard: If drawn value is less than $30, I'll bid approximately 50% of the value. This conservative approach safe-guards against losses and provides data on lower-value bidding trends.\n\nInsights:\n\n1. Adjusted Risk Tolerance: Lowering our high-value bid percentage acknowledges the unpredictability of other bids and mitigates risk.\n   \n2. Flexibility: Having a flexible bid percentage for mid-range items allows testing of the impact of slight bid variations, important in fine-tuning our strategy.\n   \n3. Other Bidders' Behavior: Learning from our competition, it's apparent there's more to winning than simply outbidding others; strategic calculations are invaluable in this auction environment. Detailed analysis of bid patterns could reveal valuable strategies.",
            "Plan: In the next rounds, for high-value draws (above 70), I'll continue to adopt an aggressive strategy but will push my bid to 90-95% of my value. This is to increase my chances of winning without sacrificing too much profit. For mid-range values (40-70), I'll increase my bid range to 80-85% of my value, slightly more aggressive than before. For low values (below 40), I will still go with risky bids but decrease the range to 30-40% to potentially safeguard against losses. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to the frequency at which maximum bids occur and adjust my tactics accordingly.\n\nInsights: A more aggressive stance for high and mid-range values seems promising considering the competition and pattern of wins in previous rounds. The low-value strategy needs fine-tuning, choosing the optimal risk level is key. An important characteristic to employ is adaptability, adjusting strategies based on observed behavior of competitors and patterns in bid results. Also, maintaining unpredictability will potentially keep competitors from accurately guessing my bid strategies. Balancing between proficiency in high-value bidding and experimentation in low-value bidding could lead to an enhanced understanding of auction dynamics."

For values between 40-70, I'll aim to bid about 80% of my value to maintain a balanced approach. For values lower than 40, I'll bid nearly the exact value to minimize possible losses. In response to losses, I will increase my bid incrementally by 2-4% as opposed to making a significant leap, thus providing a gradual shift in strategy.\n\nInsights: Mid-range bidding seems to yield consistent results. The slightly aggressive strategy seems profitable in the long run, particularly in high-value rounds. However, too much aggression has shown to sometimes result in losses. Subtly increasing the bid post losses rather than making drastic changes tends to bring better rewards and ensure a safety net. Analyzing trends and adapting from round-to-round is critical for success. Moreover, it seems throwing unexpected high bids occasionally might disrupt competitors' strategies and give an advantage, this is an area for further exploration.",

            "Plan: Based on prior rounds, it's evident that slightly aggressive bidding worked well when my value was high (above 70). I'll maintain this strategy by bidding 85-95% of my value. For mid-range values (40-70), I'll also adopt a slightly aggressive approach by bidding 55-70% of my value. With low values (below 40), I'll bid cautiously, at around 25-35% of my value. Notably, when my value is extremely low (below 10), I'll consider bidding above my value to experiment with data collection and calculate the risk/reward ratio.\n\nInsights: Observing competitors' bidding habits, I've noticed that high bids are often placed, reflecting aggressive play. Tactical bidding within the 55-95% range seems viable to be competitive, ensuring profitability with high values while minimizing loss with lower ones. It's important to have a flexible strategy for different value categories and to learn from the results. How competitors respond to aggressive or cautious bidding will help devise improved strategies in the future. Furthermore, interpreting bid history can offer guidance on identifying winning ranges."

However, overbidding in these rounds can backfire so a balanced approach is necessary. Lower value rounds don't significantly affect profits but winning them could still add to the total by a considerable amount. Disruptive high bidding occasionally seems a promising strategy and is worth to be explored further. The trick is not to be predictable while avoiding significant losses.

Mid-Range Experiment: For bids within $30-$70, values, let's decrease our bid percentage to 60-70% of the item's value as the previous strategy comes with high risks and doesn't yield substantial profit.\n\n3. Low-Value Preservation: For items under $30, maintain the 50% bid approach to avoid major losses. However, it may benefit us to slightly increase our bids to around 55% in an attempt to win more auctions.\n\nInsights:\n\n1. Risk Mitigation: It seems that bidding very high percentage of the item's value leads to increased risk while not necessarily leading to significant rewards. More moderate bidding percentages may be more profitable in the long run.\n\n2. Tactical Flexibility: It is important to adapt our bidding strategy based on the strategies used by other bidders. Observing other bidders' habits can provide us with valuable insights.\n\n3. Incremental Adjustment: Making incremental adjustments to our bidding strategy based on past results is key to long-term profitability. Quick, dramatic changes may lead to risky outcomes.",
            "Plan: In upcoming rounds, I will execute a moderate strategy based on my prior insights. When I draw a high value (above 70), I will bid between 70-80% of my value to increase chances of winning, lowering the risk while maintaining a decent profit margin. If I get a mid-range value (40-70), I will bid 50-60% of my value, slightly lower than previously but to ensure competitiveness. For low value rounds (below 40), I will bid cautiously around 20-30% of my value. In more experimental rounds, if my drawn value is extremely low (below 10), I'll bid above my value to gather strategic data. \n\nInsights: My more aggressive strategy is often outbid, suggesting that competitors also have aggressive tendencies. It's essential to adapt my strategy based on their bidding behavior. Bidding too close to my value in high rounds can reduce profit margins, so a conservative approach could yield better outcomes. Previous rounds indicate that confident bidding often wins, but the trade-off is in profit. Testing lower bids in high-value rounds will help track potential larger profit margins and provide direction for future strategies."
