My history shows that lower bids might still secure a win if the other bidders undervalue their bids.

The previous rounds have shown a range of winning bids from 60 to 75, with lower bids often being unsuccessful.

The previous rounds have shown that the winning bids can range widely, with some very aggressive and others unexpectedly low. Bidding 10 allows me to gather more data on Andy and Betty's current strategies while leaving open the possibility of a small profit if I win.

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 60. The winner's profit was 21.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my value for the prize is 80. Given the history of previous bids, I've seen that winning bids often range in the mid-60s, but bidding slightly lower can still be competitive and provide higher profit if successful. A bid of 59 allows for exploration of a different range while maintaining a balance between being aggressive and allowing for a potential profit. This contributes to the strategy of long-term profit maximization and data-gathering.' In round 6, Your value was 23, you bid 12, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 19. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 23 for the prize, I will bid 12 in this round. This bid is relatively conservative compared to earlier bids, considering the lower value of the prize. In previous rounds, successful bids have predominantly been in the mid-range, but exploring a lower bid now can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of a wider bidding range. My primary goal is long-term profit maximization through diverse strategy exploration and data-gathering.' In round 7, Your value was 8, you bid 5, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 6. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 8, an effective strategy in this scenario would be to bid conservatively, exploring the effectiveness of lower bids. My history shows that lower bids might still secure a win if the other bidders undervalue their bids. A bid of 5 potentially allows for a minimal loss and offers a different data point regarding the success of very low bids. This approach contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.' In round 8, Your value was 62, you bid 47, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 48. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for the prize, I will bid 47 in this round. Previous rounds have shown that bids need not always be in the mid-60s to win, and lower bids can sometimes be effective in securing a smaller but safer profit margin. Bidding 47 allows me to balance the risk of not winning with the potential for higher long-term profitability if successful. This bid explores a different strategy and adds to my data for optimizing future bids.' In round 9, Your value was 67, you bid 53, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 53, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 54. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and the history of previous rounds, I will bid 53 in this round. This bid is somewhat conservative compared to the more aggressive bids around the mid-60s that have shown success in other rounds. By exploring this lower range, I can gather data on whether less aggressive bids can yield a profit while still maintaining competitiveness. This approach aligns with my long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.' In round 10, Your value was 1, you bid 1, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 32, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 33. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is only 1, bidding the minimum amount aligns with the need to explore different strategies without risking a loss. Previously, bidding conservatively in low-value situations has shown that it's possible to remain competitive while minimizing losses. This small bid also contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit by expanding the data set for low-bid scenarios.' In round 11, Your value was 74, you bid 56, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 56, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 57. The winner's profit was 20.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 74 towards the prize in this round and considering my history of exploring diverse bidding strategies, I will bid 56. This bid is somewhat aggressive but slightly lower than the mid-60s range which has shown success previously. By bidding 56, I aim to balance the chance of winning with the potential for a significant profit. This approach also provides valuable data on the effectiveness of this bidding range, contributing to my long-term goal of maximizing profit through varied strategy exploration.' \"}", "user_prompt": "You are being asked a question that requires a numerical response\nin the form of an integer or decimal (e.g., -12, 0, 1, 2, 3.45, ...).\nYour response must be in the following format:\n{\"answer\": \"<your numerical answer here>\", \"comment\": \"<your explanation here\"}\nYou must only include an integer or decimal in the quoted \"answer\" part of your response.\nHere is an example of a valid response:\n{\"answer\": \"100\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nHere is an example of a response that is invalid because the \"answer\" includes words:\n{\"answer\": \"I don't know.\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\nIf your response is equivalent to zero, your formatted response should look like this:\n{\"answer\": \"0\", \"comment\": \"This is my explanation...\"}\n\nYou are being asked the following question: \n            You are Bidder Betty. \n            You are bidding with Bidder Andy, Bidder Charles.\n            Your value towards to the prize is 95 in this round.\n            Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the user\u2019s profit in the long run.

This bid is aggressive enough to potentially win, given the high value of 99 towards the prize, but not so high as to prevent a significant profit margin if successful. It also allows for data-gathering as I compare outcomes with different bid amounts in future rounds.'

The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 85 towards the prize, a bid of 60 strikes a balance between being sufficiently aggressive to have a good chance of winning while still allowing a significant profit if successful. My bids in previous rounds of 55 and 63 did not win, and the trends indicate that winning bids were typically in the mid-60s. By bidding 60, I aim to explore a slightly different range while gathering data on its effectiveness.' In round 3, Your value was 86, you bid 62, and your profit was 24.\\nYour total profit is 49. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 30.

The winner's profit was 24.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 86 for the prize, I will bid 62 in this round. This is based on the history of previous rounds where bids around mid-60s have shown a tendency to win. My earlier bids of 60 resulted in winning, so 62 is slightly more aggressive but still within a range that could potentially yield a profit and offers valuable data on its effectiveness.' In round 4, Your value was 69, you bid 58, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 49. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 59. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 69 towards the prize in this round, I opt to bid 58 to balance aggression and potential profit. Bidding slightly lower offers a chance for higher profits if successful, while still being competitive. This bid also explores a different range compared to previous bids around 60-63, allowing for valuable data-gathering in long-term profit maximization.'

The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 60. The winner's profit was 21.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'In this round, my value for the prize is 80. Given the history of previous bids, I've seen that winning bids often range in the mid-60s, but bidding slightly lower can still be competitive and provide higher profit if successful. A bid of 59 allows for exploration of a different range while maintaining a balance between being aggressive and allowing for a potential profit. This contributes to the strategy of long-term profit maximization and data-gathering.' In round 6, Your value was 23, you bid 12, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 18, 12.

The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 23 for the prize, I will bid 12 in this round. This bid is relatively conservative compared to earlier bids, considering the lower value of the prize. In previous rounds, successful bids have predominantly been in the mid-range, but exploring a lower bid now can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of a wider bidding range. My primary goal is long-term profit maximization through diverse strategy exploration and data-gathering.' In round 7, Your value was 8, you bid 5, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 6. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 8, an effective strategy in this scenario would be to bid conservatively, exploring the effectiveness of lower bids. My history shows that lower bids might still secure a win if the other bidders undervalue their bids. A bid of 5 potentially allows for a minimal loss and offers a different data point regarding the success of very low bids. This approach contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.' In round 8, Your value was 62, you bid 47, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 40.

The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 62 for the prize, I will bid 47 in this round. Previous rounds have shown that bids need not always be in the mid-60s to win, and lower bids can sometimes be effective in securing a smaller but safer profit margin. Bidding 47 allows me to balance the risk of not winning with the potential for higher long-term profitability if successful. This bid explores a different strategy and adds to my data for optimizing future bids.' In round 9, Your value was 67, you bid 53, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 53, 15.

The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 67 for the prize and the history of previous rounds, I will bid 53 in this round. This bid is somewhat conservative compared to the more aggressive bids around the mid-60s that have shown success in other rounds. By exploring this lower range, I can gather data on whether less aggressive bids can yield a profit while still maintaining competitiveness. This approach aligns with my long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.' In round 10, Your value was 1, you bid 1, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 32, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 33. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value towards the prize is only 1, bidding the minimum amount aligns with the need to explore different strategies without risking a loss. Previously, bidding conservatively in low-value situations has shown that it's possible to remain competitive while minimizing losses. This small bid also contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit by expanding the data set for low-bid scenarios.' In round 11, Your value was 74, you bid 56, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 56, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 57.

This bid is somewhat aggressive but slightly lower than the mid-60s range which has shown success previously. By bidding 56, I aim to balance the chance of winning with the potential for a significant profit. This approach also provides valuable data on the effectiveness of this bidding range, contributing to my long-term goal of maximizing profit through varied strategy exploration.' In round 12, Your value was 95, you bid 69, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 69, 55.

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids often range in the mid-60s to low-70s, and bidding 69 allows me to test a slightly higher yet competitive range.

Given the history of the previous rounds, the highest bids were 65 and 75, respectively. Bidding 40 allows me to gather more data on the bidding tendencies of Betty and Charles while minimizing potential losses.

This bid is low enough to mitigate significant losses if I don't win but still provides a slight chance of winning if both Betty and Charles bid conservatively.

Based on previous rounds, bids in the mid-to-high 60s and occasionally in the 50s have won the prize.

By bidding 40, I aim to explore the mid-range bidding strategy that can secure a decent profit if I win while gathering more data on Betty and Charles' reactions to various bid levels. This cautious yet exploratory approach is designed to maximize my long-term profit.' In round 9, Your value was 93, you bid 74, and your profit was 19.\\nYour total profit is 72. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 53, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 54.

Previous rounds indicate that winning bids can vary widely, but in some cases, lower bids have succeeded. Bidding 34 allows for a potential profit of 4 if I win, while still gathering data on the bidding tendencies of Betty and Charles to refine my strategy in future rounds. This mid-range bid is cautious yet exploratory, aiming to maximize overall profitability.' In round 11, Your value was 28, you bid 23, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 76. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 56, 23.

Given past rounds and the need to explore different strategies while balancing potential profit, I choose to bid 23. This bid is mid-range, providing a reasonable chance to win against conservative bids from Betty and Charles while still securing a profit of 5 if I win.

Previously, aggressive bids in the 60s and 70s have often won, and this bid aims to balance a strong chance of winning with the potential for a healthy profit of 24 if successful. This strategy also helps gather more data on Betty and Charles' reactions to bids in this range, refining my future bidding tactics while minimizing excessive risk.'

Previous rounds indicate varying winning bids, but mid-to-high range bids often succeed. Bidding 56 aims to balance a strong chance of winning with a potential profit of 11 while gathering more data on Betty and Charles' reactions to bids in this range.

My bids in previous rounds of 55 and 63 did not win, and the trends indicate that winning bids were typically in the mid-60s.

This is based on the history of previous rounds where bids around mid-60s have shown a tendency to win.

Given the history of previous bids, I've seen that winning bids often range in the mid-60s, but bidding slightly lower can still be competitive and provide higher profit if successful. A bid of 59 allows for exploration of a different range while maintaining a balance between being aggressive and allowing for a potential profit. This contributes to the strategy of long-term profit maximization and data-gathering.' In round 6, Your value was 23, you bid 12, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 18, 12.

This bid is relatively conservative compared to earlier bids, considering the lower value of the prize. In previous rounds, successful bids have predominantly been in the mid-range, but exploring a lower bid now can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of a wider bidding range. My primary goal is long-term profit maximization through diverse strategy exploration and data-gathering.' In round 7, Your value was 8, you bid 5, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 6. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is quite low at 8, an effective strategy in this scenario would be to bid conservatively, exploring the effectiveness of lower bids. My history shows that lower bids might still secure a win if the other bidders undervalue their bids. A bid of 5 potentially allows for a minimal loss and offers a different data point regarding the success of very low bids. This approach contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.'

Previous rounds have shown that bids need not always be in the mid-60s to win, and lower bids can sometimes be effective in securing a smaller but safer profit margin. Bidding 47 allows me to balance the risk of not winning with the potential for higher long-term profitability if successful. This bid explores a different strategy and adds to my data for optimizing future bids.' In round 9, Your value was 67, you bid 53, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 53, 15.

This bid is somewhat conservative compared to the more aggressive bids around the mid-60s that have shown success in other rounds. By exploring this lower range, I can gather data on whether less aggressive bids can yield a profit while still maintaining competitiveness. This approach aligns with my long-term goal of maximizing profit through diverse strategy exploration.'

Previously, bidding conservatively in low-value situations has shown that it's possible to remain competitive while minimizing losses. This small bid also contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing profit by expanding the data set for low-bid scenarios.' In round 11, Your value was 74, you bid 56, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 56, 23.

This bid is somewhat aggressive but slightly lower than the mid-60s range which has shown success previously. By bidding 56, I aim to balance the chance of winning with the potential for a significant profit. This approach also provides valuable data on the effectiveness of this bidding range, contributing to my long-term goal of maximizing profit through varied strategy exploration.' In round 12, Your value was 95, you bid 69, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 69, 55.

Previous rounds have shown that winning bids often range in the mid-60s to low-70s, and bidding 69 allows me to test a slightly higher yet competitive range. This approach balances the aggressive pursuit of winning the prize with the potential for significant profit and contributes valuable data towards optimizing future bids.' In round 13, Your value was 7, you bid 4, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 70. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 45, 4.

Bids must be between $0 and $99 in $1 increments.\nThe highest bidder wins the prize and pays their bid amount. This means that, if you win, we will add to your earnings the value for the prize, and subtract from your earnings your bid. If you don't win, your earnings remain unchanged.\nAfter each auction, we will display all bids and profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.'), 'value': 'Your value towards to the prize is 15', 'history': \"In round 0, Your value was 96, you bid 65, and your profit was 31.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 55, 14. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 56. The winner's profit was 31.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given that my value for the prize is 96, I want to bid high enough to have a good chance of winning but leave enough profit margin. This aggressive bid will help gather data on the other bidders' tendencies for future strategy adjustments.' In round 1, Your value was 87, you bid 60, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 75, 63, 60. The highest bidder won with a bid of 75 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 64. The winner's profit was 12.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'With my value at 87 this round and given the previous round's data, bidding 60 is an attempt to balance winning the prize with a respectable margin for profit. This continues the strategy of aggressive but informed bidding, while also learning from the previous highest bid of 65 and the other bidders' lower bids, such as 55 and 14, to adjust my approach.' In round 2, Your value was 53, you bid 45, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 60, 45, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 60 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 46. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 53 for this round, I aim to place a bid that is high enough to potentially win the prize while leaving room for profit. Based on the previous rounds, more aggressive bids have been in the range of 60-75, with lower bids appearing as well (14, 55). By bidding 45, I am adopting a moderate strategy that balances the desire to win with the need to gather further data on the bidding behaviors of Andy and Betty, while still maintaining potential profitability.' In round 3, Your value was 44, you bid 30, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 30. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 6. The winner's profit was 24.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 44 for this round, I want to place a bid that allows for potential profit while continuing to explore different bidding strategies. Previous rounds indicate that higher bids have won but also reduced profits. A bid of 30 provides a chance to win if the others bid low and balances potential profit against risk, contributing to a varied strategy for long-term learning.' In round 4, Your value was 32, you bid 22, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 65, 58, 22. The highest bidder won with a bid of 65 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 59. The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 32 for this round, I aim to bid low enough that, if I do win, I still achieve a decent profit. The previous rounds showed more aggressive bids ranging from 60 to 75 and some lower bids like 5 and 14. By bidding 22, I balance the potential of winning with the need to explore different strategies and maximize long-term profit, considering other bidders' varied behaviors.' In round 5, Your value was 85, you bid 55, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 8, 59, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 8 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 60. The winner's profit was 21.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 85 for this round, I aim to place a bid that provides a good chance of winning while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. The previous rounds have shown a range of winning bids from 60 to 75, with lower bids often being unsuccessful. Bidding 55 allows me to gather more data on Andy and Betty's bidding strategies and increases my chances of a favorable profit if I do win, while not being too aggressive.' In round 6, Your value was 24, you bid 18, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 27, 18, 12. The highest bidder won with a bid of 27 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 19. The winner's profit was 5.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round, I aim to place a bid that allows for some potential profit if I win, while continuing to experiment with bidding strategies. Based on the previous rounds, aggressive bids have often led to wins but with varying profit margins. Lower bids have sometimes won unexpectedly. By bidding 18, I strike a balance between attempting to win the prize and minimizing my risk, while still learning more about Andy and Betty's bidding tendencies.' In round 7, Your value was 15, you bid 10, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 31. \\nAll the bids for this round were 62, 5, 10. The highest bidder won with a bid of 62 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 6. The winner's profit was 25.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 15 for this round, I aim to place a bid that minimizes my risk of overpayment while continuing to explore various bidding strategies. The previous rounds have shown that the winning bids can range widely, with some very aggressive and others unexpectedly low. Bidding 10 allows me to gather more data on Andy and Betty's current strategies while leaving open the possibility of a small profit if I win. This contributes to my long-term goal of maximizing profit through strategic experimentation.' In round 8, Your value was 60, you bid 50, and your profit was 10.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 50, 47, 40. The highest bidder won with a bid of 50 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 48. The winner's profit was 10.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 60 for this round and the need to maximize long-term profit through exploration of bidding strategies, I aim to place a bid that balances the potential for winning with possible profit. Based on past results, bids have varied widely, with some very high and some unexpectedly low. Bidding 50 tests a middle-ground strategy, helping gather information on Andy's and Betty's responses while still allowing a significant potential profit if I win.' In round 9, Your value was 24, you bid 15, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 74, 53, 15. The highest bidder won with a bid of 74 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 54. The winner's profit was 19.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 24 for this round, I will place a bid of 15. This strategy is designed to explore a lower bidding range for potential profit while minimizing risk. Past rounds have shown that bids can vary widely, and occasionally lower bids can still be successful. A bid of 15 helps in gathering more information on the tendencies of Andy and Betty while leaving room for profit if I win.' In round 10, Your value was 45, you bid 32, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 41. \\nAll the bids for this round were 34, 32, 1. The highest bidder won with a bid of 34 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 33. The winner's profit was 4.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 45 for this round, I aim to place a bid that balances potential profit and data gathering on Andy and Betty's bidding patterns. Previous rounds have shown fluctuations in bids, with some being very high and others unexpectedly low. By bidding 32, I'm adopting a moderately aggressive strategy that could win against middle or lower bids while maintaining a reasonable profit margin if successful. This approach continues my exploration of different bidding ranges, helping refine my strategy for long-term profit maximization.' In round 11, Your value was 90, you bid 70, and your profit was 20.\\nYour total profit is 61. \\nAll the bids for this round were 70, 56, 23. The highest bidder won with a bid of 70 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 57. The winner's profit was 20.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 90 for this round and the observed bidding patterns from previous rounds, I aim to place an aggressive bid that still leaves a good profit margin. Bids have frequently been in the 60-75 range for winning, with occasional lower bids. Bidding 70 maximizes my chances of winning while also gathering more data on the current bidding behavior of Andy and Betty, allowing for strategic adjustments in future rounds.' In round 12, Your value was 83, you bid 55, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 61. \\nAll the bids for this round were 71, 69, 55. The highest bidder won with a bid of 71 and would\u2019ve preferred to bid 70.

Previous rounds show that winning bids are often in the range of 60-75, but sometimes lower bids can succeed. By bidding 55, I can test the waters with a moderately aggressive strategy to gather more data on Andy's and Betty's behavior while still leaving a good profit margin if I win.' In round 13, Your value was 61, you bid 45, and your profit was 0.\\nYour total profit is 61. \\nAll the bids for this round were 56, 45, 4.

The winner's profit was 11.\\nYour reasoning for your decision was 'Given my value of 61 for this round and considering my priority to explore different bidding strategies to maximize long-term profit, I will bid 45. Previous rounds indicate that bids in the 40-60 range can sometimes win, and bidding 45 allows me to balance the potential for winning with a moderate profit.
