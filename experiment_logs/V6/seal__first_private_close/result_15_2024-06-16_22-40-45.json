For values less than $50, I'll opt for a conservative approach, bidding around half the given value. This balances risk and potential returns.

If they bid conservatively, I'd test a lower bid to safeguard profit. I would continually adjust my strategy based on their bidding behaviour to maximize long-term profit.

For values below 40, I'll bid conservatively, specifically 15-25, to observe how low bids fare against other bidders.
