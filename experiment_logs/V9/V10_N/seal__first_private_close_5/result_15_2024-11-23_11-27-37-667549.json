If I bid low and win, it's clear profit. If I bid high, I'm paying more for a higher value item but I'm gathering data on the other bidders' behaviours. \n\nFinal bid: $37\n\nNext round strategies: \n\n1. Observing trends in bidding behaviour to make informed decisions\n\n2. Exploring a strategy of low-balling ($10 or less) for lower risks and smaller but guaranteed profits\n\n3. Testing an aggressive high bid ($90 - $99) to absolve risk-tolerance and risk-averseness of other bidders.",

If they bid low, I'd consider bidding high next time and vice versa. Regarding regret, this is a part of the learning process, as regrets are necessary to adjust my strategy. Moving forward, I plan to closely observe other bidder\u2019s strategies and adjust my own bid accordingly by testing variable percentages above/below my value, sometimes opting for aggression or a conservative approach depending on the auction's trend and other bidders' behaviors.",
