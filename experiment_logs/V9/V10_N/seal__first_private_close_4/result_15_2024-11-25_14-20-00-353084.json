However, each bid allows me to learn about the other bidders' tactics, providing valuable data for future rounds.",

If my bid is too high and I win, the actual value added to my profit could outweigh the high bid in the long run. If I lose because my bid is too low, it's a learning opportunity, not a regret. \n\nFor my final bid in this round, considering the random nature of the game and value of the prize, I opt to bid $50.",

This will provide a balance between risk and potential profit. After observing the bidding behavior of Andy, Betty, and Charles, I may adjust. If they maintain consistently low bids, I'll increase my bid, possibly to around 70-80% of my value to seize the opportunity. Conversely, if they tend to overbid, I'll lower my stakes slightly to a safer 30-40%, aiming to profit in the long run rather than loosing drastically in a single round. Mistakes are costly."
