            "To maximize long-term profit, I will test several bidding strategies. First, I will bid just above my value (e.g., 64 for A, 78 for B) to see if I can win items individually at low cost. Next, I'll try a combined bid slightly above double my sum value (280) to test if I can secure both items at a competitive price. Lastly, I'll vary my bids aggressively (e.g., high bids of 90+ or conservative bids at value) to gather data on rival behavior. I'll adjust future bids based on these outcomes.",

In the next round, try a more aggressive bid on AB (around $90) to see if combined bidding is profitable and check if it wins over A and B individual sums. Adjust bids on A, B, or AB in subsequent rounds based on observed patterns and competitors\u2019 strategies. Alternate conservative and aggressive bids in cycles to gather diverse data, ensuring a balance between winning and maximizing long-term profit.",
            "For the next rounds, I plan to test varying bidding strategies strategically. Initially, I'll bid aggressively for AB, say 46, to learn about other bidders' behaviors and profit potential. If outbid, I'll gradually reduce my AB bids while exploring A and B independently. For A, start at 20 and B at 2 to test reactions. I'll adjust based on my profit margins and competitors' bids. Observing patterns and consistently tweaking bids to maximize profitability in the long run is critical. Recording historical data will be instrumental for optimizing future bids."

Concurrently, I'll run a conservative bid for A at 6 and skip bidding on B. This mixed strategy allows me to gather data on competitor behavior and better understand the trade-offs in future rounds. Adjusting based on past bids and outcomes will inform subsequent strategies.",

This spread will help in understanding opponents' patterns and their max bids, assisting in refining future bid strategies."
