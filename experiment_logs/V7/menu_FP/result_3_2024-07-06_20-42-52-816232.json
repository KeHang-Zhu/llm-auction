Additionally, I may bid low on single goods when my value for them is low, to gather data on average winning bids. Furthermore, if I notice specific bidding patterns from Betty or Charles, I will leverage that information in my future bids.",

Secondly, I'll bid slightly lower than my value for individual items, A and B. In rounds of lower values, I'll bid minimally for data gathering, to analyze other bidders' behavior. I'll leverage historical data to adjust my bids, particularly noting thresholds where my bids are outbid. I also intend to observe times when aggressive bidding for AB rewards more profit, given my values, for understanding profitability in future analogous settings.",

I will explore risky options like bidding my entire value for A or B, if the previous rounds indicate low competition. I aim to adjust my strategy based on previous round data and competitor behaviours."
