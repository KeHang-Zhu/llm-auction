Learn from bid outcomes and adjust future bids. This approach will balance caution and aggression to gather data and maximize profit over time.",
            "I will test aggressive bids on AB to capitalize on the high combined value. In the first round, I will bid 120 on AB to aim for maximum profit. Next, I'll place more conservative bids on individual goods, like 40 on A and 15 on B, to analyze competitor behavior and prices. Additionally, I will alternate between high-risk and low-risk bids in subsequent rounds, closely reviewing previous results to identify patterns and adjust my strategy for long-term profit maximization.",
            "In the next few rounds, I will test a mix of conservative and aggressive strategies. Initially, I will bid slightly above my value for A (e.g., $24) and a minimal bid for B (e.g., $1) to gauge opponents' patterns. Then, I will place an aggressive bid close to my value combined (AB) like $45 to potentially secure both goods. I will alternate these strategies to gather data on my opponents' reactions and adapt accordingly to maximize profit."
