            "In the next few rounds, I'll alternate between aggressive and conservative bids. First, I'll place competitive bids on A (around 55-60) and B (around 65-70) separately to observe how high the opponents bid. Then, I'll try very high bids on AB (around 180) to test the waters. Lastly, I'll also place a modest bid on AB (around 120-130) to see if I can win both goods at lower prices. This varied strategy will provide insights into opponents' bidding tendencies and help me refine my approach for maximum long-term profit.",

I'll start by bidding $65 for AB to gauge how aggressively the others bid for combined goods. Simultaneously, I'll place bids of $30 for A and $10 for B individually. This approach allows me to gather data on competitors' bidding patterns without overcommitting resources. Observing how frequently AB wins compared to individual goods will inform future strategies.",
            "Review past rounds to identify patterns in Andy and Betty\u2019s bidding behavior. For this round, test an aggressive strategy by bidding slightly above my valuation for both A and B ($24 for A, $3 for B), and a high bid for AB ($50). This explores the threshold at which I win AB and ensures data collection across a range of scenarios. Record outcomes to adjust bids and strategies in future rounds. This approach aims to gather insights while taking calculated risks to maximize long-term profit."
