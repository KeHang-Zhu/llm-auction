I'll analyze the outcomes to refine my strategy.",
            "I will test a few different bidding strategies to gather data. First, I'll place a moderate bid of 50 on A and a minimal bid (e.g., 1) on B to see if I can secure A at a good price. Next, I'll place a higher bid of 100 on AB to explore if going aggressive on the combined bid can secure both items fiscally beneficially. Lastly, I'll try a balanced bid of 35 on A and 10 on B to find a middle ground. Monitoring results will guide future refinements.",
            "In the next round, I'll test three strategies: 1) Place a high aggressive bid on AB around my combined value of 48 to see how others react. 2) Bid slightly above my perceived values on A and B individually to collect more data on Andy and Betty's bidding patterns. 3) In some rounds, place lower bids or abstain to gather more intel on their strategy. Record all outcomes meticulously to strategize future bids effectively."
