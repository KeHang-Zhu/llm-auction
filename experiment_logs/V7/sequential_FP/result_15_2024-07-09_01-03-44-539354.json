By observing bid patterns of Andy and Charles over several rounds, I might risk bidding slightly above my value for B, if the potential long term profit justifies it. I'll also consider bid trends when deciding whether to bid on AB.",

If I win the first stage, my bid for good B will be moderate ($40-$50), balancing the valuation and keeping enough margin for profit.
