Don't forget the values are redrawn independently each round.This is the first round \n Your value towards to the prize is {'A': 22, 'B': 2} in this round.Your PLAN for this round is:To maximize profit, I'll test the following strategies: Initially, bid 23 on A to just exceed my value, enabling data-gathering on competitors' bids. For B, bid low, around 3, since my value is low. Alternate aggressive bids on A (e.g., 40) while keeping B minimal, capturing win rates and competitor behavior. In subsequent rounds, bid incrementally higher amounts on B (e.g., 10, 20) to track how bidding affects outcomes. Adjust bid patterns based on observed winning bids and prices.
