Later, I will adjust my bids based on the outcome of previous rounds, potentially using an aggressive strategy by bidding up to 100% of their values if I observe low competition. Lastly, I will also explore bidding near my values for AB combined if I continue to win A and B individually at attractively low prices, thus maximizing long-term profit.",

If unsuccessful, I'll increase my bid for B in subsequent rounds. If I'm consistently winning A, I'll lower my bid slightly to optimize profit. Alternatively, I'll consider a package bidding strategy with my full value for A and B combined, testing if higher overall bid could win both. I'll adjust these strategies based on observed bidding behaviour and maintain focus on maximizing my overall profit.",
            "I plan to split my bid based on the proportion in which I value goods A and B. Considering the values for A (22) and B (2), I'd put a higher bid on A than B. Also, I'd try an aggressive strategy, bidding near my maximum value for A, while minimal for B. However, to account for the substantial combined value, I'd also bid for 'AB' aggressively. As per historical data, If standard bidding doesn't work or competition is high, I plan to bid significantly above my value, making it risky yet potentially profitable."
