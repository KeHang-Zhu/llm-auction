            "Initially, I'll bid slightly above my valuations: approximately 44 for A and 2 for B. This helps understanding opponents' strategies and reaction to my bids. Post data analysis, if opponents are not aggressive, maintaining or slightly increasing my bids might be enough. If they show aggressive behavior, I will respond with considerably higher bids for A (since it's more valuable) and possibly lower or constant for B. By fluctuating my bids for A, I can provoke reactions to understand their bidding limits. With B, I'll bid at my valuation to minimize losses.",
            "My plan would involve three strategies. First, bid low on both A and B for initial rounds, to gauge my opponents' tendencies. Second, heavily bid on B (my higher value item), while occasionally shifting to a more balanced strategy to prevent predictability. Lastly, take a more aggressive approach later in the game, increasing my bids when other bidders have less cash, maximizing my chances. Remember, each round's values are arbitrary and independent, so learning from the past auction styles of other bidders is key for strategizing. Testing various strategies helps me understand the game and opponents better.",
            "I plan to use a balanced bidding strategy where I bid more on B and less on A to reflect my values for both. I might bid 60 on B and 20 on A. This strategy reduces risk of overspending for A. However, I'll monitor subsequent rounds; if I keep losing on B, I might bid higher or adopt aggressive bidding. If I win A too easily, I might reduce my bid to increase profit. I'll maintain flexibility adjusting my strategy based on outcomes and variance in competitor bidding behaviours. Experimenting with different tactics is key for long term profit."
