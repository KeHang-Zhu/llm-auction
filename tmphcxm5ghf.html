You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.
In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders. You will play this game for 10 rounds. 
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.
Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. 
When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
The previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out'].
Your value towards to the prize is 8 in this round.
The current price in this clock cycle is 1. The price for next clock cycle is 2.
Do you want to stay in the bidding? 
If you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. 
If you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.
Your response must use these EXACT tags below. Don't miss the action.

You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles.
In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against 2 other bidders. You will play this game for 10 rounds. 
At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and 20, with all values equally likely.
Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in 1 USD increments, up to a maximum of 40. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders. 
When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
The previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 0, no players dropped out'].
Your value towards to the prize is 8 in this round.
The current price in this clock cycle is 1. The price for next clock cycle is 2.
Do you want to stay in the bidding? 
If you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. 
If you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding.
Your response must use these EXACT tags below. Don't miss the action.
